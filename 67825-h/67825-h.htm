    <div><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Ses divertissements sont infiniment moins raisonnables que</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c011'>A brilliant and daring thinker lately published
some admirable papers called ‘Under
the Yoke of the Butterflies.’ The only thing which
I would have changed in those delightful satires
would have been the title. There are no butterflies
in this fast, furious and fussy age. They all died
with the eighteenth century, or if a few still lingered
on into this, they perished forever with the dandies.
The butterfly is a creature of the most perfect taste,
arrayed in the most harmonious colours: the butterfly
is always graceful, leisurely, aerial, unerring in
its selection of fragrance and freshness, lovely as the
summer day through which it floats. The dominant
classes of the present day have nothing in the least
degree akin to the butterflies; would to Heaven that
they had! Their pleasures would be more elegant,
their example more artistic, their idleness more
picturesque than these are now. They would rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>peacefully on their roses instead of nailing them to
a ballroom wall; they would hover happily above
their lilies and carnations without throwing them
about in dust and dirt at carnivals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Butterflies never congregate in swarms; it is only
locusts which do that. Butterflies linger with languorous
movement, always softly rhythmical and
undulating even when most rapid, through the sunny
air above the blossoming boughs. The locust is
jammed together in a serried host, and tears breathlessly
forward without knowing in the least why or
where he goes, except that he must move on and
must devour. There is considerable analogy between
the locust and society; none between society
and the butterfly. But be the yoke called what it
will, it lies heavily on the world, and there is no
strength in the strongest sufficient to lift it up and
cast it off, for its iron is Custom and its ropes are
Foolishness and Bad Example, and what is termed
Civilisation carries it as the steer carries the nose-ring
and the neck-beam.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some clever people have of late been writing a
great deal about society, taking English society as
their especial theme. But there are certain facts and
features in all modern society which they do not
touch: perhaps they are too polite, or too politic.
In the first place they seem to except, even whilst
attacking them, smart people as elegant people, and
to confuse the two together: the two words are
synonymous in their minds, but are far from being
so in reality. Many leaders of the smart sets are
wholly unrefined in taste, loud in manner, and followed
merely because they please certain personages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>spend or seem to spend profusely, and are seen
at all the conspicuous gatherings of the season in
London and wherever else society congregates. This
is why the smart sets have so little refining influence
on society. They may be common, even vulgar; it
is not necessary even for them to speak grammatically;
if they give real jewels with their cotillon toys
and have a perfect artist at the head of their kitchens,
they can become ‘smart,’ and receive royalty as
much and as often as they please. The horrible word
smart has been invented on purpose to express this:
smartness has been borrowed from the vocabulary
of the kitchenmaids to express something which is at
the top of the fashion, without being necessarily
either well born or well bred. Smart people may be
both the latter, but it is not necessary that they
should be either. They may be smart by mere force
of chance, impudence, charm, or the faculty of making
a royal bored one laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, therefore, impossible for the smart people to
have much influence for good on the culture and
manners of the society they dominate. A <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>beau monde</i></span>,
really exclusive, elegant and of high culture, not to
be bought by any amount of mere riches or display,
would have a great refining influence on manner and
culture, and its morality, or lack of it, would not
matter much. Indeed, society cannot be an accurate
judge of morality; the naughty clever people know
well how to keep their pleasant sins unseen; the
candid, warm-hearted people always sin the sole sin
which really injures anybody—they get found out.
‘You may break all the ten commandments every
day if you like,’ said Whyte Melville, ‘provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>only you observe the eleventh, “Thou shalt not be
found out.”’ There is a morality or immorality, that
of the passions, with which society ought to have
little or nothing to do; but there is another kind with
which it should have a good deal to do, <i>i.e.</i>, the low
standard of honour and principle which allows persons
in high place to take up <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>richards</i></span> for sheer sake of
their wealth, and go to houses which have nothing to
recommend them except the fact that convenient
rendezvous may be arranged at them, or gambling
easily prosecuted in them. But it is not society as
constituted at the present year of grace which will
have either the courage or the character to do this.
Theoretically, it may condemn what it calls immorality
and gambling, but it will always arrange its house-party
in accord with the affinities which it sedulously
remembers and ostensibly ignores, and will allow bac’
to follow coffee after dinner rather than illustrious
persons should pack up and refuse to return.</p>

<p class='c001'>At risk of arousing the censure of readers, I confess
that I would leave to society a very large liberty in
the matter of its morality or immorality, if it would
only justify its existence by any originality, any
grace, any true light and loveliness. In the face of
its foes lying grimly waiting for it, with explosives in
their pockets, society should justify its own existence
by its own beauty, delicacy and excellence of choice
and taste. It should, as Auberon Herbert has said,
be a centre whence light should radiate upon the rest
of the world. But one can only give what one has,
and as it has no clear light or real joy within itself it
cannot diffuse them, and in all probability never will.
‘The Souls’ do, we know, strive in their excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>intentions and their praiseworthy faith to produce
them, but they are too few in numbers, and are already
too tightly caught in the tyres of the great existing
machinery to be able to do much towards this end.
After all, a society does but represent the temper of
the age in which it exists, and the faults of the
society of our time are the faults of that time itself;
they are its snobbishness, its greed, its haste, its
slavish adoration of a royalty which is wholly out of
time and keeping with it, and of a wealth of which
it asks neither the origin nor the solidity, and which
it is content only to borrow and bask in as pigs in
mud.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not luxury which is enervating; it is over-eating,
over-smoking, and the poisoned atmosphere of
crowded rooms. Edmond de Goncourt likes best to
write in a grey, bare room which contains nothing to
suggest an idea or distract the imagination. But few
artists or poets would desire such an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>entourage</i></span>.
Beauty is always inspiration. There is nothing in a
soft seat, a fragrant atmosphere, a well-regulated
temperature, a delicate dinner, to banish high thought;
on the contrary, the more refined and lovely the place
the happier and more productive ought to be the
mind. Beautiful things can be created independently
of place; but the creator of them suffers when he can
enjoy beauty only in his dreams. I do not think that
the rich enjoy beauty one whit more than the poor in
this day. They are in too great a hurry to do so.
There is no artistic enjoyment without repose. Their
beautiful rooms are scarcely seen by them except
when filled with a throng. Their beautiful gardens
and parks are visited by them rarely and reluctantly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Their treasures of art give them no pleasure unless
they believe them unique, unequalled. Their days,
which might be beautiful, are crammed with incessant
engagements, and choked with almost incessant eating.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England the heavy breakfasts, the ponderous
luncheons, the long, tedious dinners, not to speak of
the afternoon teas and the liqueurs and spirits before
bedtime, fill up more than half the waking hours;
‘stoking,’ as it is elegantly called, is the one joy which
never palls on the human machine, until he pays
for it with dyspepsia and gout. People who live
habitually well should be capable of denying their
appetites enough to pass from London to Paris, or
Paris to London, without wanting to eat and drink.
But in point of fact they never dream of such denial
of the flesh, and they get out at the buffets of Boulogne
and Amiens with alacrity, or order both breakfast and
dinner, with wines at choice, in the club-train. A
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>train de luxe</i></span> is, by <a id='corr6.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the the'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_6.19'><ins class='correction' title='the the'>the</ins></a></span> way, the epitome and portrait
of modern society; it provides everything for
the appetite; it gives cushions, newspapers and iced
drinks; it whirls the traveller rapidly from capital to
capital; but the steam is in his nostrils, the cinder
dust is in his eyes, and the roar of the rattling wheels is
in his ears. I do not think that plain living and high
thinking are a necessary alliance. Good food, delicate
and rich, is like luxury; it should not be shunned,
but enjoyed. It is one of the best products of what is
called civilisation, and should be duly appreciated by
all those who can command it. But feeding should
not occupy the exaggerated amount of time which is
given to it in society, nor cost the enormous amount
of money which is at present spent on it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Luxury in itself is a most excellent thing, and I
would fain see it more general, as the luxury of the
bath was in Imperial Rome open to one and all;
with the water streaming over the shining silver and
snowy marbles, and the beauty of porphyry and jade
and agate gleaming under the silken awning, alike
for plebeian and patrician. It is not for its luxury
for a moment that I would rebuke the modern world:
but for its ugly habits, its ugly clothes, its ugly hurry-skurry,
whereby it so grossly disfigures, and through
which it scarcely even perceives or enjoys the agreeable
things around it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Luxury is the product and result of all the more
delicate inventions and combinations of human intelligence
and handicraft. To refuse its graces and
comforts would be as unwise as to use a rudely-sharpened
flint instead of a good table-knife. A far
more lamentable fact than the existence of luxury is
that it is so little enjoyed and so rarely made general.
We deliberately surrender the enjoyment of the
luxury of good cooking because we most stupidly
mix up eating with talking, and lose the subtle and
fine flavours of our best dishes because we consider
ourselves obliged to converse with somebody on our
right or our left whilst we eat them. We neutralise
the exquisite odours of our finest flowers by the
scent of wines and smoking dishes. We spoil our
masterpieces of art by putting them together pell-mell
in our rooms, smothered under a discordant
mingling of different objects and various styles. We
allow nicotines to poison the breath of our men and
women. We desire a crowd on our stairs and a crush
in our rooms as evidence of our popularity and our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>distinction. We cannot support eight days of the
country without a saturnalia of slaughter. We are so
tormented by the desire to pack forty-eight hours
into twenty-four, that we gobble our time up breathlessly
without tasting its flavour, as a greedy schoolboy
gobbles up stolen pears without peeling them.
Of the true delights of conversation, leisure, thought,
art and solitude, society <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en masse</i></span> has hardly more
idea than a flock of geese has of Greek. There is in
the social atmosphere, in the social life of what is
called ‘the world,’ a subtle and intoxicating influence
which is like a mixture of champagne and opium,
and has this in common with the narcotic, that it is
very difficult and depressing to the taker thereof to
leave it off and do without it. As La Bruyère said
of the court life of his time, it does not make us
happy but it makes us unable to find happiness
elsewhere. After a full and feverish season we have
all known the reaction which follows on the return to
a quiet life. There is a magnetic attraction in the
great giddy gyrations of fashionable and political
life. To cede to this magnetism for a while may be
highly beneficial; but to make of it the vital necessity
of existence, as men and women of the world now do,
is as fatal as the incessant use of any other stimulant
or opiate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great malady of the age is the absolute inability
to support solitude, or to endure silence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Statesmanship is obscured in babbling speech;
art and literature are represented by mere hurried
impressions snatched from unwillingly-accorded
moments of a detested isolation; life is lived in a
throng, in a rush, in a gallop; the day was lost to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Titus if it did not record a good action; the day is
lost to the modern man and woman unless it be spent
in a mob. The horror of being alone amounts in our
time to a disease. To be left without anybody else
to amuse it fills the modern mind with terror. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘La
solitude n’effraie pas le penseur: il y a toujours
quelqu’un dans la chambre,’</span> a witty writer has said;
but it is the wit as well as the fool in this day who
flies from his own company; it is the artist as well
as the dandy who seeks the boulevard and the crowd.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is nothing more costly than this hatred of
one’s own company, than this lack of resources and
occupations independent of other persons. What
ruins ninety-nine households out of a hundred is the
expense of continual visiting and inviting. Everybody
detests entertaining, but as they all know that
they must receive to be received, and they cannot
bring themselves to support solitude, people ruin
themselves in entertainment. There can scarcely be
a more terrible sign of decadence than the indifference
with which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>grands de la terre</i></span> are everywhere
selling their collections and their libraries. Instead
of altering the excessive display and expenditure
which impoverish them, and denying themselves that
incessant amusement which they have grown to consider
a necessity, they choose to sell the books, the
pictures and the manuscripts which are the chief
glories of their homes; often they even sell also their
ancestral woods.</p>

<p class='c001'>This day, as I write, great estates which have been
in the same English family for six hundred years are
going to the hammer. This ghastly necessity may
be in part brought about by agricultural depression,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>but it is far more probably due to the way of living
of the times which must exhaust all fortunes based
on land. If men and women were content to dwell
on their estates, without great display or frequent
entertainment, their incomes would suffice in many
cases. It is not the old home which ruins them: it
is the London house with its incessant expenditure,
the house-parties with their replica of London, the
women’s toilettes, the men’s shooting and racing and
gaming, the Nile boat, the Cairene winter, the weeks
at Monte Carlo, the Scotch moors, the incessant,
breathless round of intermingled sport and pleasure
danced on the thin ice of debt, and kept up frequently
for mere appearances’ sake, without any genuine
enjoyment, only from a kind of false shame and a
real inability to endure life out of a crowd.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a stimulant and a drug, as I have said, in
the curious mixture of excitement and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>, of
animation and fatigue, produced by society, and
without this mixture the man and woman of the
world cannot exist; and to find the purchase-money of
this drug is what impoverishes them, and makes them
indifferent to their own degradation, and sends their
beautiful old woods and old books and old pictures to
the shameful uproar of the sale-rooms. If the passion
for the slaughter of tame creatures which is almost an
insanity, so absorbing and so dominant is it, could be
done away with in England, and the old houses be
really lived in by their owners all the year round with
genuine affection and scholarly taste, as they were
lived in by many families in Stuart and Georgian
days, their influence over the counties and the villages
would be incalculable and admirable, as Mr Auberon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Herbert and Mr Frederick Greenwood have recently
said; and the benefit accruing to the fortunes of the
nobles and gentry would be not less.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not only in England that men have become
bored by and neglectful of their great estates. All
over Italy stand magnificent villas left to decay or
tenanted by peasants, the lizard creeping in the
crevices of forgotten frescoes, the wild vine climbing
over the marbles of abandoned sculptures, the oranges
and the medlars falling ungathered on the mosaics of
the mighty and desolate courts. Why is this? In
the earlier centuries men and women loved pleasure
well, and had few scruples; yet they loved and
honoured their country houses, and were happy in
their fragrant alleys and their storied chambers, and
spent magnificently on their adornment and enrichment
with a noble pride. It is only now in the latest
years of the nineteenth century that these superb
places are left all over Europe to dust, decay, and
slow but sure desolation, whilst the owners spend
their time in play or speculation, call for bocks and
brandies in the club-rooms of the world, and buy
shares in mushroom building companies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marion Crawford observes dryly ‘that it is useless
to deny the enormous influence of brandy and games
of chance on the men of the present day.’ It is indeed
so useless that no one who knows anything of
our society would dream of attempting to deny it,
and if we substitute morphia for brandy, we may say
much the same of a large proportion of the women of
the present day. Drinking and gambling, in some
form or another, is the most general vice of the cultured
world, which censures the island labourer for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>his beer and skittles, and condemns the continental
workman for his absinthe and lotteries. It is a
strange form of progress which makes educated
people incapable of resisting the paltry pleasures of
the green-table and the glass; a strange form of
culture which ends at the spirit frame, the playing
cards, and the cigar box. The poor Japanese coolie
amongst the lilies and lilacs of his little garden is
surely nearer both culture and progress than the
drinker and the gambler of the modern clubs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Reflect on the enormous cost of a boy’s education
when he belongs to the higher strata of social life, and
reflect, also, that as soon as he becomes his own
master he will, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred,
take advantage of his liberty only to do what
Crawford’s young Don Orsino does, <i>i.e.</i>, drink brandy,
gamble at bac’, and try to gain admittance into the
larger gaming of the Bourses. It will certainly be
allowed by any dispassionate judge, that a better result
might be arrived at with such exorbitant cost;
that a nobler animal ought to be produced by such
elaborate and wholly useless training.</p>

<p class='c001'>Drinking and gambling (in varied forms it is true,
but in essence always the same) are the staple delights
of modern life, whether in the rude western shanty of
the navvy, the miner and the digger, or in the
luxurious card-rooms of the clubs and the country
houses of the older world. We have even turned
all the rest of creation into living dice for us, and the
horse trots or gallops, the dog is fastened to the show-bench,
the pigeon flies from the trap, even the rat
fights the terrier that our fevered pulses may beat still
quicker in the unholy agitation of a gamester’s greed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>We are great gamblers, and the gambler is always
a strangely twisted mixture of extravagance and
meanness. Expenditure is not generosity; we are
lavish but we are not liberal; we will waste two
thousand pounds on an entertainment, but we cannot
spare five pounds for a friend in distress. For the
most part we live not only up to but far beyond our
incomes, and the necessary result is miserliness in
small things and to those dependent on us.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Ses divertissements sont infiniments moins raisonnables
que ses ennuis,’</span> says Pascal of the society of
his day, and the statement stands good of our own.
Society has no pleasure which is graceful or elevating,
except music; but music listened to in a crowd loses
half its influence; and it is an insult to the most
spiritual of all the arts to regard it, as it is regarded
in society, as a mere interlude betwixt dinner and
the card-table. There is little except music which is
beautiful in the pageantries of this day. A ball is still a
pretty sight if it takes place in a great house, and if not
too many people have been invited. But except this,
and this only in a great house, all entertainments are
unsightly. No decoration of a dinner-table, no gold
plate, and orchidæ, and electric light, and old china
can make even tolerable, artistically speaking, the
sight of men and women sitting bolt upright close
together taking their soup around it. A full concert-room,
lecture-room, church, are a hideous sight. A
garden party in fair weather and fine grounds alone
has a certain grace and charm; but garden parties,
like all other modern spectacles, are spoilt by the
attire of the men, the most frightful, grotesque and
disgraceful male costume which the world has ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>seen. When the archæologists of the future dig up one
of our bronze statues in trousers they will have no need
to go further for evidence of the ineptitude and idiotcy
of the age. What our historians call the dark ages had
costumes, alike for the villein and the seigneur, adapted
to their needs, serviceable, picturesque and comely;
this age alone, which vaunts its superiority, has a
clothing for its men which is at once utterly unsightly,
unhealthy, and so constructed that all the bodily
beauty of an Apollo or an Achilles would be obscured,
caricatured, and deformed by it. The full height of
its absurdity is reached when the glazier comes in his
black suit to mend your windows, and brings his
working clothes in a bundle to be put on ere he works
and put off ere he goes into the street. The political
incapacity with which the natives of Ireland are
charged by English statesmen never seemed to me so
conclusively proven as by their persistence in wearing
ragged tail-coats and battered tall hats in their stony
fields and on their sodden bogs. A man who cannot
clothe his own person reasonably is surely a man
incapable of legislating for himself and for his kind.
This rule, however, if acted on, would disfranchise
Europe and the United States.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a society which had any true perception of
beauty, grace, or elegance, the masher would be impossible;
the shoulder-handshake, the tall hat, the
eternal cigarette, the stiff collar, the dead birds on the
ball-dresses and bonnets, the perspiring struggles of
the sexes on the tennis ground, and a thousand other
similar things would not be for a moment endured.
To a society which had any high standard of refinement
such entertainments as are appropriately called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>‘crushes’ would be insupportable; the presence and
the speeches of women on public platforms would be
intolerable; all the enormities of the racecourse would
be abhorrent; its fine ladies would no more wear
dead humming-birds upon their gowns than they
would wear the entrails of dead cats; its fine gentlemen
would no more gather together to murder hand-fed
pheasants than they would shoot kittens or
canaries; to a truly elegant society everything barbarous,
grotesque and ungraceful would be impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>An incessant and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>maladif</i></span> restlessness has become
the chief characteristic of all cultured society nowadays:
it is accounted a calamity beyond human endurance
to be six months at a time in one place; to
remain a year would be considered cause for suicide.
The dissatisfaction and feverishness which are the
diseases of the period are attributed to place most
wrongly, for change of place does not cure them and
only alleviates them temporarily and briefly. Here,
again, the royal personages are the first offenders and
the worst examples. They are never still. They
are never content. They are incessantly discovering
pretexts for conveying their royal persons here and
there, to and fro, in ceaseless, useless, costly and
foolish journeys.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every event in their lives is a cause or an excuse
for their indulgence in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pérégrinomanie</i></span>; if they are
well, they want change of scene; if they are ill, they
want change of air; if they suffer a bereavement,
nothing can console them except some agreeable
foreign strand; and the deaths, births and marriages
of their innumerable relations furnish them with continual
and convenient reasons for incessant gyrations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>In all these multiplied and endless shiftings of place
and person the photographs fly about in showers, and
the gold and silver offerings are tendered in return on
bended knees.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be confessed that royalty confirms and
keeps up many usages and obligations of society
which are absurd and unpleasant, and which without
royal support would die a natural death.</p>

<p class='c001'>What can be more absurd, more childish, and more
utter waste of money than the salutes with which
it is the custom to celebrate the going and coming,
the births and the deaths, of these royal people? The
savage who expresses his joy by discharging his rusty
musket is deemed a silly creature; but the civilised
nation is less excusably silly which expresses its
pleasure, its grief, and its homage by means of this
hard, ugly, unpleasant noise which has no sense in it,
and blows away in smoke vast sums of money which
might easily be better spent. It is a barbarous
practice, and it is difficult to comprehend a civilised
world tamely submitting to its continuance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most vulgar form of salutation, the shake-hands,
has been adopted and generalised by princes,
until it is now usual in countries where it was unknown
in the beginning of the century. Nothing can
be more ludicrous and ungraceful, or more disagreeable,
than the ‘pump-handling’ which is common in
all ranks of society, and which great personages
might easily have abolished altogether. They think
it makes them popular, and so they resort to it on
every suitable and unsuitable occasion. There can
be no possible reason why people should go through
this unpleasant action, and few sights are more absurd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>than to see two elderly gentlemen solemnly sawing
each other’s arms up and down as they meet before
the doorsteps of their club. The slight smile and
scarcely perceptible bend of the head which are all
with which well-bred people recognise their acquaintances
at a reception or a ball, is fully sufficient for
all purposes of recognition at any period of the day,
and can amply preface conversation. The pressure
of hands should be left to lovers, or to friends in
moments of impulses of emotion; on leave-taking
before, or on welcome after, a long absence. There
are many men still in Europe, not all old men either,
who know how to greet a woman, and bend low over
her hand and touch it lightly with their lips; and how
graceful, how respectful, how suggestive of homage
is that courtly salutation! It is the fault of women
that it has become the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we had Charles the First on the throne of
England, and Louis Quatorze on the throne of
France, whatever political difficulties might come of
it, manners would certainly be considerably altered,
corrected and refined. The influence of some great
gentleman might do much to purge the coarseness
and commonness of society out of it; but such a
personage does not exist, and if he did exist, the
Augean stable would probably be too much for his
strength. He would retire, like Beckford, to some
Fonthill and build a Chinese Wall between him and
the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>But alas! the vulgarity of the age is at its highest
in high places. The position of sovereigns and their
descendants is one which should at least allow them
to be the first gentry of their countries in feeling as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>they are in precedence and etiquette; they might,
were they capable of it, set an example of grace, of
elegance, and of purity of taste. Strong as is the
revolutionary leaven amongst the masses, the force of
snobbism is stronger still, and all habits and examples
which come from the palace are followed by the
people with eager and obsequious servility. If, when
princes and princesses were united in wedlock, they
ordained ‘No presents,’ the abominable blackmail
levied by betrothed people on their acquaintances
would cease to be fashionable, and would soon become
‘parcel and portion of the dreadful past.’ If, when
princes and princesses paid the debt of nature, the
Court officials sent out the decree ‘No flowers,’ all
other classes would take example, and the horrible,
senseless barbarism of piling a mass of decaying
wreaths and floral crosses upon a coffin and a grave
would pass to the limbo of all other extinct barbaric
and grotesque customs. But they are careful to do
nothing of the kind. The bridal gifts are too welcome
to them; and the funeral baked meats are too
savoury; and all the royal people all over Europe unite
in keeping up these tributes levied from a groaning
world. Modern generations have made both marriage
and death more absurd, more banal, and more vulgar
than any other period ever contrived to do; and it is
not modern princes who will endeavour to render
either of them simple, natural and dignified, for the
essence and object of all royal life in modern times
is vulgarity, <i>i.e.</i>, publicity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all spectacles which society flocks to see, it may
certainly be said that the funeral and the wedding are
the most intolerably coarse and clumsy. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>indeed a curious and comical likeness between these
two. Both take place in a crowd; both are the cause
for extortion and expenditure; both are attended
unwillingly and saluted with false formulæ of compliment;
both are ‘seen out’ and ‘got through’ with
sighs of relief from the spectators; and both are
celebrated with the sacrifice of many myriads of
flowers crucified in artificial shapes in their honour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hymen and Pallida Mors alike grin behind the
costly and senseless orchids and the sweet dying
roses and lilies of the jubilant nurseryman. The
princes and the tradespeople have in each case
decreed that this shall be so; and society has not
will or wisdom enough to resist the decree.</p>

<p class='c001'>A poet died not long ago and left amongst his
farewell injunctions the bidding to put no flowers
on his bier. The wise press and public exclaimed,
‘How strange that a poet should hate flowers!’
Poor fools! He loved them so deeply, so intensely,
that the tears would start to his eyes when he beheld
the first daffodils of the year, or leaned his lips on
the cool pallor of a cluster of tea roses. It was
because he loved them so well that he forbade their
crucified beauty being squandered, to fade and rot
upon his coffin. Every true lover of flowers would
feel the same. Nothing more disgusting and more
offensive can be imagined than the cardboard and
wires on which the tortured blossoms are fastened in
various shapes to languish in the heated atmosphere
of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chambre ardente</i></span>, or in the sickly and oppressive
air of a mortuary chamber. All the designs which
serve to symbolise the loves of cook and potboy on
St Valentine’s Day are now pressed into the service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the princely or noble mourners; harps, crowns,
crosses, hearts, lyres, and all the trash of the vulgarest
sentiment are considered touching and exquisite
when hung before a royal catafalque or heaped upon
a triple coffin of wood, lead and velvet. In all these
grotesque and vulgar shapes the innocent blossoms
are nailed, gummed, or wired by workpeople, grinning
and smoking as they work, and the whole mass is
heaped together on bier, in crypt, or on monument,
and left to rot and wither in sickening emblem of the
greater corruption which it covers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fresh-gathered flowers laid by maidens’ hands
on the wet hair of Ophelia, or the white breast of
Juliet, might have beauty both natural and symbolical.
One spray of some best-loved blossom,
placed by some best-loved hand on the silenced
heart, may have the meaning and be the emblem of
the deepest feeling. To put softly down upon a bed
of moss and rose-leaves the dead white limbs of a
little child may have fitness and beauty in the act.
To go in the dusk of dawn into the wet, green
ways of gardens, silent save for the call of waking
birds, and gather some bud or leaf which was dear to
our lost love, and bear it within to lie with him where
we can never console or caress him in his eternal
solitude: this may be an impulse tender and natural
even in those first hours of bereavement. But to
arise from our woe to order a florist to make a harp
of lilies with strings of gold or silver wire; to stay
our tears, to break the seals of boxes come by rail
from Nice and Grasse and Cannes: this indeed is
to fall into bathos beside which the rudest funeral
customs of the savage look respectable and dignified.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>When we realise what death is and what it means:
that never will those lips touch ours again; that never
will that voice again caress our ear; that never more
will our inmost thoughts be mirrored in those eyes;
that never more shall we say, ‘Shall we do this to-day?
shall we do that to-morrow?’ that never more
can we go together through the grass of spring, or together
watch the sun drop down behind the hills;
that never can we ask pardon if our love were
fretful, human, weak; that never more can there be
communion or comprehension; that all is silent, lonely,
ended, an unchanging and unchangeable desolation:—when
we realise this, I say, and think that there
are persons who, left to this awful solitude, can give
orders to floral tradesmen and take comfort in toys of
cardboard and wire, we may be pardoned if we feel
that the most bitter scorn of the cynic for human
nature is flagellation too merciful for its triviality and
folly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Truly, in nine times out of ten it is but a conventional
and unreal sorrow which thus expresses itself;
truly, out of the millions of deaths which take place
there are but few which create deep and abiding grief;
still, the association of these elaborate artificial wreaths
and garlands, these stiff and crucified blossoms, with
the tomb would only be possible to the most vulgar
and insensible of generations, even as decoration,
even as mere common-place compliment, whilst to the
true lover of flowers they must be ever a distressing
outrage.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Lopez de Vega’s <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Diego de Alcala</cite></span> the humble
servant of a poor hermit, lowliest of the low, begs
pardon of the flowers which he gathers for the chapel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and begs them to forgive him for taking them away
from their beloved meadows. This is a worthier
attitude before those divine children of the dews and
sun than the indifference of the lovers of the flower
carnival or the funeral pageant.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a daisy were but as scarce as a diamond, how
would the multitudes rush to adore the little golden-eyed
star in the grass!</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most exquisitely beautiful things I ever
saw in my life was a thick tuft of harebell glittering
all over with dew on a sunny morning where it grew
on a mossy wall. It was not worth sixpence, yet it
was a thing to kneel down before and adore and
remember reverently for evermore.</p>

<p class='c001'>Who will deliver us, asks George Sala, from the
fashionable bridal, from the eternal ivory satin and
the ghastly orange-blossom, and the two little shavers
masquerading as pages?</p>

<p class='c001'>The roughest and rudest marriage forms of savage
nations are less offensive than those which are the
received and admired custom of the civilised world.
There cannot be a more Philistian jumble of greed,
show, indecency and extravagance than are compressed
into the marriage festivities of the cities of
Europe and America. When the nuptials are solemnised
in the country, something of country simplicity
and freshness may enter into them, but almost all
fashionable weddings are now taken to the cities,
because a huge enough crowd cannot be gathered
together even in the biggest of big country houses.
Often the persons concerned go to an hotel, or
borrow a friend’s mansion for the celebration of the
auspicious event.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Year after year the same trivial and tiresome usage,
the same vulgar and extravagant customs, the same
barbarous and uncouth ceremonies prevail, and are
accepted as sacred and unalterable law. The most
intimate, the most delicate, the most personal actions
and emotions of life are set out in the full glare of
light in the most unscreened and most unsparing
publicity; and no one sees the odious and disgusting
coarseness of it all. The more sensitive and refined
temperaments submit meekly to the torture of its
commands.</p>

<p class='c001'>If marriage, so long as the institution lasts, could
become in its celebration that which decency and
good taste would suggest, a simple and sacred rite
with neither publicity nor gaudy expenditure to profane
it, there might come, with such a change, similar
alteration in other ceremonies, and sentiment might
have a chance to put in its modest plea for place unfrightened
by the loud beating of the brazen drums
of wealth. In all the annals of the social life of the
world there has not been anything so atrocious in
vulgarity as a fashionable wedding, whether viewed in
its greedy pillaging of friends and acquaintances or in
its theatrical pomp of costume, of procession and of
banquet. It is the very apogee of bad taste, incongruity
and indecency, from the coarse words of its
rites to its sputtering champagne, its unvaried orations,
and its idiotic expenditure. It is this publicity which
is dear to the soul of our Gaius and Gaia; for were it
not so there would be more special licences demanded,
since these are not so costly that gentle-people could
not easily afford to have their marriage ceremony as
entirely private as they pleased. But they would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>feel any pleasure at privacy; they despise it; they
are always ready with gag and rouge for the foot-lights;
if they had not an audience the bride and
bridegroom would yawn in each other’s faces. Every
ceremony duly repeats and carefully imitates those
which have preceded it. There is no originality,
there is no modesty, there is no dignity or reserve.
The plunder which is called ‘presents’ are laid out
on exhibition, and the feverish anxiety of every bride-elect
is to get more presents than any of her contemporaries.
Even the in-door and out-door servants
of each of the two households have this shameless
blackmail levied on them; and gillies subscribe for a
hunting-watch, and kitchen-maids contribute to the
purchase of a silver-framed mirror. Scarcely even is
a royal or aristocratic marriage announced than the
laundries and the pantries are ransacked for sovereigns
and half-sovereigns to purchase some costly
article to be offered to their princely or noble employers.
Imagine the slaves of Augustus presenting
him with a gold whistle, or the comedians of Louis
Quatorze offering him a silver cigar-box!</p>

<p class='c001'>But all is fish which comes to the nets of the impecunious
great folks of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fin de siècle</i></span>, and the
unhappy households must submit and buy a propitiatory
gift out of their salaries. That households are
notoriously dishonest in our day is but a necessary
consequence. Who can blame a servant if, knowing
the blackmail which will be levied on him, he recoups
himself with commissions levied in turn upon tradesmen,
or perquisites gleaned from the wine-cellars?
It is said openly, though I cannot declare with what
truth, that all the gifts in gold and silver and jewels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>which are offered to princes on their travels by loyal
corporations or adoring colonists are sold immediately,
whilst all the costly boxes and jewelled trifles which
such princes are obliged by custom to leave behind
them wherever they have been received are similarly
disposed of by the greater number of their
recipients. It is, perhaps, the reason why royal donors
so frequently limit themselves to the cheap gift of a
signed photograph. They know that photographs
cannot be offered to them in return.</p>

<p class='c001'>The diffusion of German influence, which has been
general over Europe through the fatality which has
seated Germans on all the thrones of Europe, has had
more than any other thing to do with the vulgarisation
of European society. The German eats in public,
kisses in public, drags all his emotions out into the
public garden or coffee-house, makes public his curious
and nauseous mixture of sugar and salt, of jam and
pickles, alike in his sentiments and in his cookery, and
praises Providence and embraces his betrothed with
equal unction under the trees of the public square.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the influence of courts being immense, socially
and personally, society throughout Europe has been
Germanised; scholars love to point out the far-reaching
and deeply penetrating influence of the Greek
and Asiatic spirit upon Rome and Latium; historians
in a time to come will study as curiously the effect of
the German influence on the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, and that of royal houses upon nations in an
epoch when royalty drew near its end.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to German and royal influence that English
society owes the introduction of what are called silver
and golden weddings, of which the tinsel sentiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>and the greedy motive are alike most unlovely.
Gaius and Gaia grown old, proclaim to all their
world that they have lived together for a quarter or a
half century in order that this fact, absolutely uninteresting
to any one except themselves, may bring
them a shower of compliments and of gifts. They
may very probably have had nothing of union except
its semblance; they may have led a long life of
bickering, wrangling and dissension; Gaius may
have wished her at the devil a thousand times, and
Gaia may have opened his letters, paid his debts out
of her dower, and quarrelled with his tastes ever since
their nuptials: all this is of no matter whatever; the
twenty-five or the fifty years have gone by, and are
therefore celebrated as one long hymn of peace and
harmony, the loving-cup is passed round, and blackmail
is levied on all their acquaintances. ‘Old as he
is, he makes eyes at my maid because she is young
and fresh-coloured!’ says Gaia in her confidante’s
ear. ‘The damned old hag still pulls me up if I only
look at a pretty woman!’ grumbles Gaius in his club
confidences. But they smile and kiss and go before
the audience at their golden wedding and speak the
epilogue of the dreary comedy which society has
imposed on them and which they have imposed on
society. And the buffets of their dining-hall are
the richer by so many golden flagons and caskets
and salvers given by their admiring acquaintances,
who are not their dupes but who pretend to be so in
that unending make-believe which accompanies us
from the nursery to the grave. The union may have
been virtually a separation for five-sixths of its term;
the ill temper of the man or the carping spirit of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>woman, or any one of the other innumerable causes
of dissension which make dislike so much easier and
more general than affection, may have made of this
‘married life’ an everlasting apple of discord blistering
the lips which have been fastened to it. Nevertheless,
because they have not been publicly separated,
the wedded couple, secretly straining at their chains,
are bound after a certain term of years to receive the
felicitations and the gifts of those around them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grotesqueness of these celebrations does not
seem to strike any one. This century has but little
humour. In a witty age these elderly wedded pairs
would be seen to be so comical, that laughter would
blow out their long-lit hymeneal torch, and forbid the
middle-aged or aged lovers to undraw the curtains of
their nuptial couches. Love may wither in the flesh,
yet keep his heart alive maybe—yes, truly—but if
Love be wise, he will say nothing about his heart
when his lips are faded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Old men and women, with grandchildren by the
hundred, and offspring of fifty years old, should have
perception enough of the ridiculous not to speak of
a union which has so many living witnesses to its
fruitfulness. The tenderness which may still unite
two aged people who have climbed the hill of life
together, and are together descending its slope in the
grey of the coming night, may be one of the holiest,
as it is certainly the rarest, of human sentiments, but
it is not one which can bear being dragged out into
the glare of publicity. What is respectable, and even
sacred, murmured between ‘John Anderson my jo,
John,’ and his old wife as they sit in the evening on
the moss-grown wall of the churchyard, where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>will soon be laid side by side together for evermore, is
ridiculous and indecent when made the theme of after-dinner
speeches and newspaper paragraphs. No true
feeling should ever be trumpeted abroad; and the
older men and women grow, the more bounden on
them becomes the reserve which can alone preserve
their dignity. But dignity is the quality in which
the present period is most conspicuously deficient.
Those who possess it in public life are unpopular with
the public; those who possess it in private life are
thought pretentious, or old-fashioned and stiff-necked.</p>

<p class='c001'>The French expression for being fashionable, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dans le
train</i></span>, exactly expresses what fashion now is. It is to
be remarkable in a crowd indeed, but still always in a
crowd, rushing rapidly with that crowd, and no longer
attempting to lead, much less to stem it. Life lived
at a gallop may be, whilst we are in the first flight,
great fun, but it is wholly impossible that it should be
very dignified. The cotillon cannot be the minuet.
The cotillon is sometimes a very pretty thing, and
sometimes a very diverting one, but it is always a
romp. I would keep the cotillon, but I would not
force every one to join in it. Society does force
every one to do so, metaphorically speaking; you
must either live out of the world altogether or you
must take the world’s amusements as you find them,
and they are nowadays terribly monotonous, and not
seldom very unintelligent, and a severe drain upon
both wealth and health. Youth, riches and beauty
may have ‘a good time,’ because they contain in
themselves many elements of pleasure; but this ‘good
time’ is at its best not elegant and always feverish; it
invents nothing, it satisfies no ideal, it is full of slavish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>imitation and repetition, and it is bored by tedious
and stupid ceremonies which everyone execrates, but
no one has the courage to abolish or refuse to
attend.</p>

<p class='c001'>One is apt to believe that anarchy will sooner or
later break up our social life into chaos because it
becomes so appalling to think that all these silly and
ugly forms of display and pompous frivolity will go
on for ever; that humanity will be for ever snobbishly
prostrate before princes, babyishly pleased with stars
and crosses, grinningly joyful to be packed together
on a grand staircase, and idiotically impotent to
choose or to act with independence. There appears
no possibility whatever of society redressing, purifying,
elevating itself; the unsavoury crowd at the
White House reception and the Elysées ball is only
still more hopelessly ridiculous and odious than the
better-dressed and better-mannered throng at St
James’s or the Hofburg. The office-holder in a republic
has as many toadies and parasites as an archduke
or a <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>kronprinz</i></span>. The man who lives in a shanty
built of empty meat and biscuit tins on the plains of
Nevada or New South Wales is by many degrees a
more degraded form of humanity than his brother
who has stayed amongst English wheat or Tuscan
olives or French vines or German pine-trees: many
degrees more degraded, because infinitely coarser and
more brutal, and more hopelessly soaked in a sordid
and hideous manner of life. All the vices, meannesses
and ignominies of the Old World reproduce
themselves in the so-called New World, and become
more vulgar, more ignoble, more despicable than in
their original hemisphere. Under the Southern Cross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of the Australian skies, cant, snobbism, corruption,
venality, fraud, the worship of wealth <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, are more
rampant, more naked, and more vulgarly bedizened
than beneath the stars of Ursa Major. It is not from
the mixture of Methodism, drunkenness, revolver-shooting,
wire-pulling, and the frantic expenditure
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>richards</i></span> who were navvies or miners a week ago,
that any superior light and leading, any alteration
for the better in social life can be ever looked for.
All that America and Australia will ever do will
be to servilely reproduce the follies and hopelessly
vulgarise the habits of the older civilisation of
Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is decreasing, fading, disappearing more and
more every year is something more precious than any
mere enjoyment or embellishment. It is what we
call high breeding; it is what we mean when we say
that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon sang ne peut mentir</i></span>. All the unpurchasable,
unteachable, indescribable qualities and instincts
which we imply when we say he or she has ‘race’
in him, are growing more and more rare through the
continual alliance of old families with new wealth.
We understand the necessity of keeping the blood of
our racing and coursing animals pure, but we let their
human owners sully their stock with indifference so
long as they can ‘marry money,’ no matter how that
money has been made. The effect is very visible;
as visible as the deterioration in the manners of
the House of Commons since neither culture nor
courtesy are any longer exacted there, and as the
injury done to the House of Lords by allowing
it to become a retreat for retired and prosperous
tradesmen.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>It is reported that Ravachol, who was not especially
sound at the core himself, stated it as his opinion
that society is so rotten that nothing can be done
with it except to destroy it. Most sober thinkers,
who have not Ravachol’s relish for the pastimes of
crime, must yet be tempted to agree with him. Who
that knows anything at all of the inner working of
administrative life can respect any extant form of
government? Who that has studied the practical
working of elective modes of choice can fail to see
that there is no true choice in their issues at all, only
endless wire-pulling? Who can deny that all the
legislation in the world must for ever be powerless to
limit the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sub rosa</i></span> influence of the unscrupulous man?
Who can deny that in the struggle for success,
honesty and independence and candour are dead-weights,
suppleness and falsehood, and the sly tact
which bends the knee and oils the tongue, are the
surest qualities in any competitor? Who can frame
any social system in which the enormous, intangible
and most unjust preponderance of interest and influence
can be neutralised, or the still more unjust preponderance
of mere numbers be counteracted?</p>

<p class='c001'>Some thinkers predict that the coming ruler, the
working man, will change this rottenness to health;
but it may safely be predicted that he will do nothing
of the kind. He will be at the least as selfish, as
bribable, and as vain, as the gentry who have preceded
him; he will be certainly coarser and clumsier in his
tastes, habits, and pleasures, and the narrowness of his
intelligence will not restrain the extravagance of his
expenditure of moneys not his own, with which he
will be able to endow himself by legislation. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Socialism would, in reality, break up the deadly
monotony of modern society, who would not welcome
it? But it would do nothing of the kind. It would
only substitute a deadlier, a still triter monotony;
whilst it would deprive us of the amount of picturesqueness,
stimulant, diversity and expectation which
are now derived from the inequalities and potentialities
of fortune. The sole things which now save
us from absolute inanity are the various possibilities
of the unexpected and the unforeseen with which the
diversity of position and the see-saw of wealth now
supply us. The whole tendency of Socialism, from
its first tentatives in the present trades unions, is to
iron down humanity into one dreary level, tedious and
featureless as the desert. It is not to its doctrines
that we can look for any increase of wit, of grace and
of charm. Its triumph would be the reign of universal
ugliness, sameness and commonness. Mr Keir
Hardie in baggy yellow trousers, smoking a black
pipe close to the tea-table of the Speaker’s daughters,
on the terrace of the House of Commons, is an exact
sample of the ‘graces and gladness’ which the democratic’
apotheosis would bestow on us.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not the cap and jacket of the Labour member,
or the roar of the two-legged wild beasts escorting
him, which will open out an era of more elegant
pleasure, of more refined amusement, or give us a
world more gracious, picturesque and fair. Mob rule
is rising everywhere in a muddy ocean which will
outspread into a muddy plain wherein all loveliness
and eminence will be alike submerged. But it is
not yet wholly upon us. There is still time for
society, if it care to do so, to justify its own existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>ere its despoilers be upon it; and it can only
be so justified if it become something which money
cannot purchase, and envy, though it may destroy,
cannot deride.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CONSCRIPTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>In a recent interview with Lord Wolseley, the
visitor states that he obtained from that officer
the following vehement declaration in favour of enforced
and universal military service:—</p>

<p class='c001'>‘You develop his physical power, you make a man
of him in body and in strength, as the schools he had
been at previously had made a man of him mentally.
You teach him habits of cleanliness, tidiness, punctuality,
reverence for superiors, and obedience to those
above him, and you do this in a way that no species
of machinery that I have ever been acquainted with
could possibly fulfil. In fact, you give him all the
qualities calculated to make him a thoroughly useful
and loyal citizen when he leaves the colours and
returns home to civil life. And of this I am quite
certain, that the nation which has the courage and
the patriotism to insist on all its sons undergoing
this species of education and training for at least two
or three generations, will consist of men and
women far better calculated to be the fathers and
mothers of healthy and vigorous children than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>nation which allows its young people to grow up
without any physical training although they may
cram their heads with all sorts of scientific knowledge
in their national schools. In other words, the
race in two or three generations will be stronger,
more vigorous, and therefore braver, and more calculated
to make the nation to which they belong great
and powerful.’</p>

<p class='c001'>It is obvious that such a rhapsody could only be
uttered by one who has never studied the actual
effects of conscription on a population, but speaks
merely of what he has been led to believe is its effect
from what he has watched on the drill-grounds of
countries little otherwise known to him. It is a
sweeping assertion, still less grounded on fact than
its corresponding declaration, that school makes a
man of its pupil mentally, which is by no means
always or inevitably the case. I could not, of course,
propose to contravene any purely military statement
of a military celebrity, but this composite and wholesale
and most amazing declaration I do dispute, and
I think that I know more of the effects of compulsory
service than does its speaker. Lord Wolseley has
never certainly dwelt, even for a short time, in those
countries which are cursed by conscription. He sees
that the battalions of conscripted armies seem to
him to march well and manœuvre finely, and he
concludes, with natural military prejudice, that the
results, moral and mental, of conscription on a nation
are admirable, and are unattainable in any other
manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>To begin with, he considers evidently as beyond
all dispute that the soldier is the highest type of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>humanity, which may be doubted, and that obedience
is the highest human virtue, which may be also
doubted. All the finest freedoms of mankind have
been obtained, not by obedient, but by utterly disobedient,
persons; persons who, if they had failed,
would have been thrown into prison or sent to
scaffolds. Obedience in the child is the first and the
highest virtue, because the whole well-being of the
child, material and moral, depends on it. But the
man, to be a man, must be courageous enough to
disobey if disobedience be needed by honour, justice,
or wisdom. There are moments, even in war and
even in a soldier’s life, when the magnificent daring
which disobeys is a more precious quality than the
primmer and more decorous one of unquestioning
deference to commands received. In older times the
modes of warfare or the manner of civil life left much
freer scope to idiosyncrasy and choice, much wider
space for the play of spirit and originality. Modern
warfare, like modern education, tends yearly to draw
tighter the bonds with which it buckles down all
natural growth of character and possibility of adventure.
Mechanical reproduction is the chief note
of military effort as of civil. The soldier, like the
civilian, every year tends more and more to become
only one infinitesimal atom of a rivet in the enormous
and overwhelming engine of the State.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a young man of genius, or even of merely
great talent, it is certain that the enforced term of
military service would be sorely and indelibly injurious.
Genius does not easily obey, and all the
harsh, unlovely, stupid routine of camp and barrack
would be so odious to it that a youth of brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>gifts and promise might easily be compromised and
condemned, continually and fatally, in his passage
through the ranks. Even were such a youth
obedient to his duties, the sheer waste of time, the
dispiriting influences of a long period of tedious,
irksome, and detested occupations, would have the
most depressing and dwarfing effect upon his talent.
History teems with instances, which it would be
tiresome to enumerate, in which revolt and refusal
have produced for the world all that we most prize of
liberty, of conscience, and of conduct. Revolt and
refusal are disobedience, and they have frequently
been quite as noble and fruitful as the more passive
virtue of obedience, which not seldom has taken
the form of timorous submission to, and execution
of, conscious wrong. Would Lord Wolseley have
admired or condemned a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mousquetaire</i></span> of the Louvre
who should have refused to fire on the Huguenots
from the windows?</p>

<p class='c001'>But were obedience the first of virtues, conscription
does not teach it: it enforces it, which is a very
different thing. You do not put a quality into a man
because you taught him and forced from him by fear
the simulacrum of it. Because the conscript has for
a term of years, to his bitter hatred and despite, been
compelled to obey at the point of the bayonet, he
does not thereby become a more willingly obedient
man; he will, on the contrary, as soon as he is set
free, revenge himself by insubordination to his
parents, his employers, his superiors, in all the ways
which may be open to him. The obedience exacted
from the soldier is taken by force: he obeys because
he knows that those stronger than himself will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>punish him badly if he do not. This is not an
ennobling sentiment, nor is it one which can lend
any beauty or nobility to a character. You are not
a better or a kinder master because you have been a
slave, nilly-willy, for three of the best years of your
life. Obedience which is rendered out of true veneration
may be a tonic to the nature which is bent
by it; but the obedience which is merely rendered,
as all conscripts’ obedience is, because if it be not
given the irons and the cell will follow, does no one
any moral good, teaches no virtue which can be
productive hereafter. There is no servant, groom,
artisan, farm-labourer, or hireling of any kind so lazy,
so impudent, so insubordinate, and so useless as the
young man who has recently come out from his term
of compulsory service. It is natural that it should
be so. As we cannot create morality by Act of
Parliament, so we cannot create character by the
knapsack and the cross-belts. Family education,
even school education, can in a measure mould
character, because it is the long, free, malleable,
tender years of childhood and boyhood upon which
it works; but after twenty-one, the character does
not vitally alter much, though it will assimilate
vice and vanity with fatal quickness. When Lord
Wolseley utters the preposterous declaration that
the education given by conscription teaches a lad
‘all the qualities calculated to make him a thoroughly
useful and loyal citizen,’ has he the least idea of what
is the actual moral state of the barrack-yards and
barrack-rooms of the armies of the continent? Has
he ever reflected on the inevitable results of the
pell-mell confusion with which the clean-living young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>sons of gentle-people and commercial people are flung
together with the lowest ruffians from the cellars of
the cities and the caves of the mountains? Will he
even credit how constantly the healthy, hard-working,
obedient lad from the farmside or the counting-house,
who left his people, happy in his duties and clean in
body and mind, comes back to them, when his time
is over, cankered body and soul, eaten up by disease,
scornful of simple ways, too useless to work, too
depraved to wed, too puffed up with foul desires
and braggart conceits to earn the bread which he
considers his father and brothers bound to labour
to provide for him?</p>

<p class='c001'>When the youth has had purity and strength of
character and of mind enough to resist the contagion
in which he has been steeped, he will in nine
instances out of ten be a spoilt agriculturist, artisan,
student, labourer. He has been torn from his chosen
pursuit at the moment when he had begun to fairly
master it, and he is spoilt for it, he is out of joint
with it, he forgets its cunning. If he were engaged
in any of those arts which require the utmost delicacy
of touch, the ends of his fingers have become
coarse, rough, blunted, and have lost all their sensitiveness;
the porcelain-painters, the jewellers’
artificers, the makers of the inimitable <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>articles de
Paris</i></span>, suffer immeasurably from the injury done to
their finger-tips by barrack work; whilst on the other
hand the horny palms of the lads who push the
plough and use the spade have grown so softened
by what is to them the lighter work of the barracks,
that they writhe with pain when they go out on their
farms and the skin soon is stripped off the raw flesh.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>To a military commander it is natural that the diffusion
of the military temper should appear the beau
ideal of improvement. Every class has its own intrinsic
vanity, and sees in itself the salt and savour of
society. But in truth there is a distinct menace to
the world, in the present generalisation of the military
temper, which is and must always be accompanied
by narrowness and domination. What the young
man acquires from his years of enforced service is
much more often the hectoring and bullying temper
characteristic of the soldier to the civilian, than it
is the obedience, humility and loyalty which Lord
Wolseley believes that he brings away with him.
It is certainly most unjust that the soldier should
be regarded, as in England, inferior to the civilian,
and hustled out of theatres and concert-rooms; but
it is still worse for the community when the soldier
can fire on citizens, slash at greybeards, and run
through children with impunity, as he can do in
Germany, at his will and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c001'>The very rules and qualities which are inevitable
for the well-being of the soldier are injurious to the
character of the civilian: mill-like routine, and unquestioning
acceptance of orders, are not the makers
of virile or high-minded men in civil life, however
necessary they may be in battalions. Linesmen and
gunners are admirable and useful persons, but they
are not the supreme salt of the earth that we should
endeavour to make all humanity in their likeness.
The military education creates a certain sort of
man, an excellent sort of man in his way, and for
his purpose; but not the man who is the best product
of the human race.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The story of Tell may be a myth or a fact, but
whichever it be, the refusal to bow to the cap on
the pole represents a heroism and a temper finer
than any which militarism can teach, and which
are, indeed, altogether opposed to it Even were
the regiment the school which Lord Wolseley is
pleased to believe it, why should he suppose that
there are no others as good or better? The old
apprenticeships, which have been done away with,
were strict in discipline and insistent on obedience,
and they are now considered too severe in consequence.
Yet they were schools which kept a youth
constantly within the practice of his art or trade.
Conscription takes him away from it. It unsettles
a young man at the precise moment in his life when
it is most necessary that he should be confirmed in
his tastes for and practice of his chosen occupation.
It sends him from his village to some city, perchance
hundreds of miles away, and keeps shifting him from
place to place, imbuing him with the sickly fever of
unrest, which is the malady of the age, and rendering
his old, quiet, home-rooted life impossible to him.
There can be nothing worse for him than the
barrack life; at times very harsh and onerous and
cruel, but with long, lazy pauses in it of absolute
idleness, when the lad, lying in the sun on the
stone benches, dozes and boozes his hours away,
and the vicious rogue can poison at will the ear of
the simple fool.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lord Wolseley considers it an admirable machinery
for creating citizens; it is not so, because
the individual it creates is a mere machine, with
no will of his own, with all virility and spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>beaten and cursed out of him, with no ideal set
before him but to wait on the will of his corporal
or captain. A soldier is at no time a good ‘all
round’ man; the military temper and standard are,
and must be, always narrow. In its most odious
and offensive forms, as in Germany, it amounts to a
brutal and most dangerous tyranny, overbearing in
its intolerable vanity, and holding civilian life of no
more account than dust.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lord Wolseley seems to imagine that where conscription
exists every man serves. In no country
does every man serve. Even in Germany a very
large proportion escape through physique or through
circumstances, through voluntary mutilation or emigration.
It is fortunate that it is so, for I can conceive
nothing so appalling to the world as would be
the forcing of the military temper down the throats
of its entire multitudes. Militarism is the negation
of individuality, of originality, and of true liberty.
Its sombre shadow is spread over Europe; its garotting
collar of steel is on the throat of the people.
’Forty-eight has produced nothing better than the
universal rule of the tax-gatherer and the gendarme.
The French Republic has the same corruption, the
same tyrannies, and the same coercion by bayonets
for which the two Empires were reviled. Germany
is a hell of despotism, prosecution and espionage.
Russia, a purely military nation, is given up to torture,
corruption, filth, and drunkenness. Italy has
recovered political freedom only to fall prostrate at
the feet of her old foe, who has ‘the double beak
to more devour.’ This is all that militarism and its
offspring, conscription, has done for the three nations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>who most loudly protested their free principles. In
the latter, at least, the whole people sweat, groan,
perish under the burdens laid upon them for the
maintenance of the vast battalions of young men
imprisoned in barrack-yards in enforced idleness
and semi-starvation, whilst the fruitful lands of the
Veneto, of Apulia, of the Emilia, of Sardinia, and of
Calabria lie untilled under the blue skies, the soil
crying for its sons, the spade and the scythe rusting
whilst the accursed sabre and musket shine.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the gain of what is termed a whole nation
under arms is estimated, the exaggeration of the
pompous phrase hides the nakedness of the fact that
large numbers of young men are lost to their country
by the means to which they resort to escape military
service. In Italy and Germany these may be counted
by legions: in France fugitives from the military law
are less numerous, because in France men are more
wedded to the native soil, and take to service more
gaily and more naturally, but in Italy and Germany
thousands flock to emigrant ships, thus choosing lifelong
self-expatriation; and every year, as the military
and fiscal burdens grow heavier, will lads go away
by preference to lands where, however hard be the
work, the dreaded voice of the drill-sergeant cannot
reach them, and they can ‘call their soul their own.’
Patriotism is a fine quality, no doubt, but it does not
accord with the chill and supercilious apathy which
characterises the general teaching and temper of this
age, and a young man may be pardoned if he deem
that his country is less a mother worthy of love than
a cruel and unworthy stepmother, when she demands
three of the fairest years of his life to be spent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>a barrack-yard, and wrings his ears till the blood
drops from them, or beats him about the head with
the butt of a musket, because he does not hold his
chin high enough, or shift his feet quickly enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>For a hundred years humanity in this generation
has been shouting, screaming, fighting, weeping,
chaunting, bleeding in search and struggle for various
forms of what has been called liberty. The only
result hitherto deducible from this is the present fact
that the nations of Europe are all watching each
other like a number of sullen and suspicious dogs.
We are told that this is peace. It is such excellent
and perfect peace that it is merely their mutual uncertainty
of each other’s strength which keeps them
from flying at each other’s throats. It is not peace
which Europe enjoys; it is an armed truce, with all
the exhausting strain on the body politic and on the
exchequer which must accompany such a state of
things. Conscription enables this state of tension to
exist, and the impatience which conscription excites
in the people renders them perpetually thirsty and
feverish for war. They fancy that war would end it;
would give them some good in return for all their
sufferings. ‘We cannot go on like this,’ is the universal
feeling on the Continent; it is the feeling created
by conscription. Conscription is the pole-axe with
which the patient labourer or citizen is brained, and
it is cut from the wood of his own roof-tree. It is
possible, probable, that conscription will be enforced
in England also, with the many other forms of servitude
which democracy assures us is liberty; but it
is certain that when it is so, the country will be no
longer the England which we have known in history.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>GARDENS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>In the charming essay called ‘Caxtoniana’ there
is a passage on gardens which is supremely true,
and which reminds us that whoever has a garden has
one chamber roofed by heaven in which the poet and
philosopher can feel at home. This passage was
written beside a bay-window opening on the stately
and beautiful gardens of the great author’s home: to
few is it given to possess such; but of any garden a
certain little kingdom may be made, be it only green
enough and well removed from city noise. Even
within cities, little gardens, such as may be seen in
the Faubourg St Martin and the Marais, where the
population is poorest and densest, may be charmingly
pretty, and a great solace to those who care for
and look on them; and it is these little nooks and
corners of gardens which give so much of its joyous
and glad aspect to the whole of Paris. The
great beauty of Rome (now since the Italian occupation
irrevocably destroyed) was in the gardens; the
shadowy, noble, antique gardens, with the embalmed
breath of the past on their air, and the eternal youth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of their flowers running wild over funeral sepulchre
and fortress wall. It is their gardens which make
the ancient cities and towns of Belgium so full of
repose, of friendliness, of the calm of Nature and
the romance of history. Public gardens, like public
parks, may be beautiful, useful, health-giving, pleasure-giving;
but still they must ever be public gardens:
it is the private gardens, the green places
dedicated to thought and to affection, which alone
are lovable, and which alone make a home possible,
even amidst the network of crowded streets.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be difficult for a Thoreau or a Wordsworth,
for Alfred Austin or for Alphonse Karr, to
find much pleasure in a public garden even historic
as that of the Luxembourg, wondrous as those of the
East, or beautiful as that of the Borghese in Rome or
the English garden of Munich. Wherever intrusion
is possible, and any movement other than that of birds
is heard, we have no garden in the fullest, sweetest
sense of the word. The lover of his garden is inevitably
and essentially exclusive. He must be so, or
the magic charm of his domain is gone. It may be a
tiny plot fenced round by a privet or box hedge, or it
may be stately pleasaunces walled in by clipped yew
and gay terraces; but it must be his alone; his to
wander in, to cherish, to dream through, undisturbed.
A public garden is a valuable pleasure-ground for a
city; but is no more a garden ‘roofed by heaven,’ in
Bulwer-Lytton’s sense of the word, than life in a hotel
and at a <i>table d’hôte</i> is a home.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gardens tend sadly to become more and more
artificial with the ever-increasing artificiality of an
age which, whilst demanding nature from its art and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>literature, becomes itself, with every breath it draws,
farther and farther removed from nature. The great
gardens of great houses in England, esteemed the
finest gardens in the world, are spoiled for those who
love them by the innumerable gardeners, by the endless
and overdone sweeping and cleaning and clipping
and pruning. A garden, like a woman may be too
neat, too stiff, too <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tiré à quatre éping les</i></span>. The remorseless
brooms and barrows in autumn trundle
away all the lovely carpet of golden and crimson
leaves, and deprive the nightingales, when they come
in spring, of their favourite and most necessary retreat.
Sweep the paths, if you will, though even they
need not be swept as smooth as a billiard-table; but
to sweep and clear away the leaves from under the
shrubberies, and from about the roots of trees, is a
fatal error, most destructive to the trees themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Corisande’s garden,’ in ‘Lothair,’ is the ideal
garden; and it is pathetic to think that, as an ideal,
it was given to the world by one esteemed of all
men the coldest and most world-hardened. But
Disraeli had a warm and enduring devotion to flowers
in his nature, and their loveliness and innocence and
‘breath of heaven’ never failed to touch the soul
which slumbered behind that glittering, artificial,
and merciless intelligence. He rightly abhorred the
elaborately-patterned beds, the dazzling assorted
colours, the formal mosaic of hues, in which the
modern gardener delights. All the sweet-smelling,
and what are now called old-fashioned, flowers are
hustled out of the way by the bedding-out system
and the present craze for geometrical arrangement.
Numbers of delicious flowers which were dear to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>heart of Herrick, fragrant, homely, kindly, hardy
things, have been banished almost out of all knowledge,
that the pelargonium, the dahlia, the calceolaria,
the coleus, and various other scentless but fashionable
flowers may fill group and border. It is a mistake.
Even the petunia and the dwarf datura, though so
sweet at sunset, cannot give such fragrance as will
yield the humble favourites of yore—the musk-plants,
the clove-pinks, the lavender, the lemon-thyme, the
moss-rose, the mignonette, and many another sweet
and simple plant which is rarely now seen out of
cottage gardens.</p>

<p class='c001'>Educated taste will spend large sums of money on
odontozlossom, catleyia and orchid, whilst it will not
glance perhaps once in a lifetime at the ruby spots
on the cowslip bells and the lovely lilac or laburnum
flowers blowing in a wild west wind. It will be a sorry
day for the flowers and the nation when the cottage
gardens of England disappear and leave the frightful
villa garden and the painfully mathematical allotment
field alone in their stead. An English cottage, such
as Creswick and Constable, as old Crome and David
Cox saw and knew them, and as they may still be
seen, with roses clambering to the eaves, and bees
humming in the southern-wood and sweetbriar, and
red and white carnations growing beside the balsam
and the dragon’s-mouth, is a delicious rural study still
linked, in memory, with foaming syllabub and ruddy
cherries, and honey-comb yellow as amber, and with the
plaintive bleating of new-born lambs sounding beyond
the garden coppice. Who that knows England has
not some such picture—nay, a hundred such pictures—in
his recollection?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>And it is in these gardens that Shakespeare’s,
Milton’s, Ben Jonson’s ‘posies’ may still be gathered;
every flower and floweret of them still known by
such names as Ophelia and Perdita gave them.
Even in winter they are not wholly dreary or colourless;
for there are their holly-bushes, their hellebore,
their rosethorn, their hepatica, and their snowdrops
to enliven them. In these times, when all the ‘realism’
of the lives of the poor is considered to lie in
squalor, famine, crime, drunkenness, and envy, it is
pleasant to know that such cottage gardens as these
are still extant, though no longer frequent, in the land
of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson; and that often, behind
the door where the climbing white rose mounts
to meet the thatch, there are still good humour, thrift,
cheerfulness and cleanliness to be found in company
with that manly content in existing circumstances
which is the only form of durable happiness or solid
virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children should never be allowed to pluck flowers,
even in the fields and hedges, merely to throw them
aside; they should be early taught reverence for this
floral beauty which is around them, and never be
permitted wantonly to break down boughs and
branches, or fill their laps with buttercups and daisies
only to leave them withered in the sun, discarded
and forgotten. To teach the small child to care
for flowers, to place them tenderly in water when
gathered, and cherish them carefully in his nursery,
is not only to give him a valuable moral lesson, but
to lead him also to a taste and feeling which will give
him, when he grows to manhood, many glad and
innocent hours, and render him thoughtful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>sympathetic when he deals with those sensitive plants,—the
souls of women.</p>

<p class='c001'>A love for flowers indicates the quickness for imagination
and the delicacy of sentiment of those in
whom it is strong. It will also be almost always
accompanied by a feeling for all other kinds of
natural beauty and woodland life. It would be
difficult to love the rose without loving the nightingale,
or cherish the hawthorn without caring for
the thrushes that build in it. The fatal tendency of
modern life is to replace natural by artificial beauty,
where beauty is not driven out of the way altogether.
Every child who is led to feel the loveliness of the
water-lily lying on the green pond-water, or of the
wild hyacinth growing in the home-wood grasses, will,
as he grows up, lend his influence and his example
to the preservation of all rural and sylvan loveliness.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the great world, and in the rich world, flowers
are wasted with painful prodigality. The thousands
and tens of thousands of flowers which die to
decorate a single ball or reception are a sad sight
to those who love them. ‘The rooms look well to-night,’
is the utmost that is ever said after all this
waste of blossom and fragrance. It is waste, because
scarcely a glance is bestowed on them, and the
myriad of roses which cover the walls do not effectively
make more impression on the eye than the
original silk or satin wall-hanging which they
momentarily replace. Growing plants may be used
in thousands for decoration without waste, but the
inordinate display of cut flowers is a pitiable destruction
of which scarcely one guest in fifty is
sensible. In bowls and baskets and jars, cut flowers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>can live out their natural space; but nailed on walls,
or impaled on wires, they are soon faded and yellow,
and the ballroom in the morning is as melancholy
a parable of the brevity of pleasure as any moralist
could desire.</p>

<p class='c001'>Church decoration is not a whit better; flowers
are wantonly sacrificed to it, and in the winter the
birds are starved through it for need of the evergreen
berries torn down in woods and gardens to adorn the
altars of men. The numbers of dead birds found in
frost and snow on moor and field have increased
enormously with the increase in church decoration.
A sheaf of grain hung up for the seed-eating birds
in winter, with some trays of meal-worms put on the
ground for the insectivorous birds, would be a more
useful form of piety than the cartload of branches and
the garlands of berries given to church and cathedral.</p>

<p class='c001'>The young should be led to cherish their flowers
as wisely as, and more tenderly than, they cherish
their gold and silver pieces in their money-boxes.
The exquisite beauty of even the humblest blossom
can only be appreciated by the eyes which gaze on it
with attention and affection. If the wild thyme, or
the shepherd’s-purse, or the cuckoo’s-eye, or any one
of the tiny blossoms of the sward and the hedge-row
were but as rare as sapphires are, the whole world
would quarrel for them; but Nature has sown these
little treasures broadcast with lavish hand, and
scarcely any one is grateful. A single flower, if taken
care of in winter, will gladden the eyes of an invalid
or cripple for days; with care and thought for it
a bunch of cut flowers, if cut at sunrise with the
dew upon them, will live the week out in water in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>any cool weather; but these lovely, joy-giving things
are wasted with the most reckless indifference.</p>

<p class='c001'>Botany may be well in its way; but incomparably
better is the practical knowledge of how to make
flowers grow, and infinitely better still is the tenderness
which turns aside not to tread on the wild flower
in the path, not to needlessly disturb the finch’s nest
in the blossoming broom. Of all emotions which
give the nature capable of it the purest and longest-lived
pleasure, the sense of the beauty of natural
things is the one which costs least pain in its indulgence,
and most refines and elevates the character.
The garden, the meadow, the wood, the orchard, are
the schools in which this appreciative faculty is cultured
most easily and enjoyably. Dostoïevsky may
find food for it on the desolate steppe, and Burns in
the dreary ploughed furrow; but to do this, genius
must exist in the man who feels: it is to the ordinary
sensibilities, the medium mind, the character which is
malleable, but in no way unusual, that this training of
the eye and of the heart is necessary: and for this
training there is no school so happy and so useful as
a garden.</p>

<p class='c001'>All children, or nearly all, take instinctive delight
in gardens: it is very easy to make this delight not
merely an instinctive, but an intelligent one; very
easy to make the arrival of the first crocus, the observation
of the wren’s nest in the ivy hedge, of the
perennial wonders of frost and of sunshine, of the
death and the resurrection of Nature, of the deepest
interest to a young mind athirst for marvels. Then
what greater joy and triumph does the world hold
than these of the child gardener with his first bouquet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of roses, his first basket of water-cress, his first handful
of sweet peas! His garden, if he be taught to
care for it in the right way, will be an unceasing
happiness to him; he will not grudge the birds a
share of his cherries, for he will value too well the
songs they sing to him; he will breathe in the fresh
home balm of the dewy sweet herbs, the wet flower
borders, and he will draw in health and vigour with
every breath; and if he reads his fairy stories and his
lays of chivalry under the blossoming limes, poetry
and history will keep for him in all after time something
of his first garden’s grace, something of the
charm of a summer playtime.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we did not know it as a fact, we should infer
from the whole tenor of the verse of Tennyson that
green old gardens, deep in their shade and placid in
their beauty, had been about him all his life from
infancy. The garden is a little pleasaunce of the
soul, by whose wicket the world can be shut out from
us. In the garden something of the Golden Age
still lingers; in the warm alleys where the bees hum
above the lilies and the stocks, in the blue shadows
where the azure butterflies look dark, in the amber
haze where the lime leaves and the acacia flowers
wave joyously as the west wind passes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The true lover of a garden counts time and seasons
by his flowers. His calendar is the shepherd’s
calendar. He will remember all the events of his
years by the trees or plants which were in blossom
when they happened. ‘The acacias were in flower
when we first met,’ or ‘the hawthorns were in blossom
when we last parted,’ he will say to himself, if not to
others; and no lovers are happier, or more spiritually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in love than those whose sweetest words have been
spoken in a garden, and who have fancy and feeling
enough to associate their mute companions in
memory with their remembered joys. No love can
altogether die which comes back upon remembrance
with every golden tuft of daffodil or every
garland of growing honeysuckle. It is the garden
scene in ‘Faust,’ it is the garden scene in ‘Romeo
and Juliet,’ which embody passion in its fullest
and its fairest hours.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>‘Blessed are the poor in spirit,’ says the
Evangelist: he should have added, Blessed
are the fools, the commonplace, the obscure, the
mediocre; blessed those who have done nothing
remarkable, thought nothing noteworthy, created
nothing beautiful, and given nothing fair and fine
to their generation! Unmolested may they dwell;
unharassed may they live their lives at their own
pleasure, unwatched may they take their daily walks
abroad, ungrudged may they find happiness, unmolested
may they indulge their grief. Their
nursery days may rest forgotten; they will not be
ransacked for reminiscences of childish petulance
or babyish frowardness. Their school years may rest
in the past, undisturbed by the grubbing of chroniclers
and commentators, amongst the playground dust,
and between the pages of the gradus. Their faults
and follies will lie quiet in the grave, and no contemporary
schoolfellow will recall their thefts of
apples or their slips in parsings; or will write to
the newspapers how they used a crib or smashed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>tradesman’s windows. Unworried, unenvied, unmisrepresented,
they will pass through life inglorious, but
at peace; and amongst the ashes of their buried years
no curious hands will poke and rake in feverish zeal
to find traces in their infancy of their bad passions,
and drag out the broken pieces of the rattles or the
ninepins they destroyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>How ignorant is genius of what it does when it
leaps up to the light of its sunrise! how little it recks
of the hornet swarm which will circle round its head, of
the viper brood which will coil round its ankles, of the
horde of stinging, prying, buzzing, poisoning insects
which will thicken the air as it passes, and hide in the
heart of the roses it gathers!</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not only the fierce light which beats upon a
throne which genius has to bear, but the lurid glare of
the sulphur fires of envy, making livid what is white,
making hideous what is fair, making distorted and
deformed what is straight and smooth and comely.</p>

<p class='c001'>The world holds a concave mirror to the face of
genius, and judges the face by the reflection.</p>

<p class='c001'>The calm consciousness of power in the great writer,
in the great artist, will always appear vanity to the
majority, because the majority is incapable of seeing
how entirely different to vanity it is, and how, if
arrogant in the world, it is always humble in the
closet; if it be conscious of its own superiority to its
contemporaries, it will be none the less conscious of
its inferiority to its own ideals. The intimate union
of pride and of humility, which is characteristic of all
genius, and pre-eminently sincere in it, can never be
understood by the world at large.</p>

<p class='c001'>Flaubert, as we know, corrected, effaced, reconstructed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>erased and altered every line of his text a
hundred times, in careless dissatisfaction with himself;
but when an editor of a review asked him to make
some corrections in the proof of St Julian Hospitador,
he haughtily replied to the meddler: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘<i>Des corrections?—j’en
donne quelquefois, mais je n’en fais jamais!</i>’</span>
Inexorable self-scourger in his study or his studio, the
man of genius is high-mettled and arrogant as an
hidalgo before interference. How should the fool
understand this?—the fool who deems himself perfect
when strutting before his mirror, but is downcast
before the first mocking glance or ridiculing word
which he encounters in the public street!</p>

<p class='c001'>Humanity loves to scoff, and say that genius is
human. No doubt it is; but its humanity is always
of a different kind to that of ordinary men. The
nightingale is classified by naturalists amongst the
tribe of the Sparrows, in the class of the Finches; but
this fact does not make the nightingale only a
sparrow, or only a finch. The nightingale sees life
and nature very differently to the sparrow, though his
physical organisation may, in some respects, resemble
his kinsman’s. It is one thing to sit on the housetops
and drink rinsings from the gutter, and another to sit
on a myrtle bough and drink dew from the heart of a
rose. How shall those to whom the rinsings are
sweet be able to judge those for whom the rose is
chalice-bearer?</p>

<p class='c001'>In a recent monograph upon his friend Meissonier,
Alexandre Dumas has quoted some petulant and
childish sayings of the great painter which would
have been better left in oblivion. Dumas prefaces
them by the phrase <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘J’ai entendu Meissonier dire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>mais peut-être, il est vrai, ne le disait-il qu’à moi:’</span>
in these last words, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘<i>ne le disait-il qu’à moi</i>,’</span> lies the
whole gist of the matter, in these few words are contained
the confession of the consciousness which
should have preserved Meissonier’s impetuous and
unconsidered self-revelations from being, after his
death, made public by his friend. It is just these
things which are said only to us, which are said
perhaps foolishly, perhaps hastily, perhaps stupidly,
but in any way said in entire good faith, and in the
conviction of the good faith of the confidant, which
should never be repeated, above all when the ground
is closed over the speakers of them. It will be said
that there is nothing in this recollection of Meissonier
which is in any way to his discredit. There is not.
Yet it is none the less a violation of confidence; and in
a sense it dwarfs the stature of him. One of the chief
characteristics of genius is an extreme youthfulness of
feeling and of impulse, often also of expression; the
great artist is always in one side of his nature a child.
But this fact, which is so lovable and engaging in him
in his lifetime, makes him continually, in his careless
and confidential utterances, say what is natural, and
may even be beautiful in its spontaneity and suitability
to the moment of its expression, but which loses its
colour, its light, its charm, as a dried and pressed
flower loses them when it is reproduced after death in
the rigidity of type.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taine set a fine example in his will when he enjoined
on his heirs to burn all the documents in
which he had written down all he had heard from his
contemporaries. The rose should be always hung
before the door wherever two or three are gathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>together in familiar intercourse, and the inquisitive,
censorious, malignant world is listening cunningly at
the keyhole. The world will not go away for the
rose; but those within should enforce respect for its
symbol, and should stuff up the keyhole.</p>

<p class='c001'>I once knew and liked for several years a
diplomatist who was very popular in society. He was
often with me, and one day he unfortunately told me
that it was his habit to write down every night, no
matter how late it might be when he went home, the
record of everything witty, or interesting, or singular,
that he had heard during the day, and the names of
all the persons whom he had met and with whom he
had conversed. ‘I have done this,’ he added, ‘ever
since I was an unpaid <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>attaché</i></span>, and these volumes,
which are many, as you may imagine, will not be
published until the time designated to my executors
in my will.’ Ever after this confession from him I saw
him with much less pleasure; these bulky volumes,
though unseen, cast their grim shadow over the present
and the future; I never again laughed and talked with
him without the recollection that he was treasuring up
the nonsense I spoke or repeated to write it down in
black and white before he allowed himself to sleep.
The thought was a ghost at every intellectual banquet
at which he and I met. I wanted to call out to our
companions,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There’s a chiel amang you takin’ notes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>As he was a man who had his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>petite entrée</i></span> into the
arcana of politics, and was personally acquainted with
the most distinguished people of Europe, he must
have burned a good deal of post-midnight oil over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>his nightly chronicle, and I wonder he could keep
awake to make it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He died some years since, and of those voluminous
records there is nothing said in the press as
yet. No doubt, however, they will see the light
some day; and some heir or heirs will make a round
sum of money out of them. There is a kind of
treason in this habit of committing to paper for
ultimate publication what is said by those around us.
If the matter be emended and emasculated when
printed, it loses all interest; if published verbatim,
the publication constitutes a betrayal. Social intercourse
is surely based on the tacit assumption that
what is said in it is said under cover of the white flag
of mutual trust. I do not think that we have any
right whatever to make any kind of private conversation
public. The motive for doing so can never be a
very high one. There is, no doubt, a great temptation
in the wish to tell what we know about a friend
whose character we see was unknown or misunderstood
by the world in general, even probably by his
intimate associates; but I doubt if we have the right
to do so. If he revealed his natural inner self more
completely to us than to others, it was no doubt
because we inspired him with a more complete confidence
or sympathy than did others. Shall that confidence
or that sympathy be abused or betrayed by
any man or woman of common honour?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a fact which is to be regretted that the
faculty of inspiring confidence is, unfortunately, often
allied to an utter faithlessness in keeping it. Those
who most attract it are often those who most betray
it. The sympathy which draws out our secrets is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>frequently united to considerable treachery in using
them. Even those who are in many ways faithful
and sincere betray after death those who trusted them
in life, by revelations of their correspondence, either
intentional or careless.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Cachez votre vie: étalez votre esprit,’</span> is a wise
counsel; but it is this which the world will not
permit if it can by any torment prevent it. He who
has once allowed his wit to shine, and dazzle the
eyes of his contemporaries, is expected to live his
life for ever afterwards with open doors.</p>

<p class='c001'>People who are famous are invariably accused of
being self-conscious, reserved, monosyllabic, lacking
in candour, in expansiveness, in inclination to converse.
What more natural than that they should be
so, since they know that their most intimate companion
may not be able to resist the temptation of
recording and retailing everything they say? If
they speak as they feel, they are accused of ‘giving
themselves away,’ as the English slang phrases it; if
they be as reserved and as silent as it is possible to
be without offence to society, they are accused of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>morgue</i></span>, of vanity, of arrogance. In either case,
whatever they do say, whether it be much or be
little, will be certainly exaggerated, misrepresented,
and disliked. Meissonier may, in a weak moment,
wish he were Fortuny; Tennyson may, in an irritable
hour, prefer money to fame; and each may say so to
a trusted companion. But it is hard that the
evanescent, unwise desire should be soberly published
many years after in each case by a hearer who was
deemed a friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are none of us, perhaps, as loyal as we ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to be in speech. We are too thoughtless in what
we repeat; and many, for sake of an epigram or a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>jeu de mot</i></span>, sacrifice the higher duties of respect for
confidence and silence on it. But speech may have
the excuse of unpremeditation, haste, the contagion
of conversation going on around. The indiscretions
of written and of printed words share none of these
excuses. Even if written in hurry or in carelessness,
there is leisure enough when a proof sheet is
received, between its reception and its publication,
for all such revelations to be effaced. Have we a
right to make public private conversations? I do
not consider that we have. Intercourse, at all events
the pleasure of intercourse, reposes on the tacit
condition that its privacy is intangible. Intimate
correspondence does the same. In letters we give
hostages to our friends. It should be understood
that such hostages are not to be led, like captives,
into the public market-place and sold.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the many memories of intimacy with Alfred
Tennyson which have been published since his death,
few would, I think, have pleased a man so reluctant
to be observed and commented on as was he. The
fulsome adulation would scarcely have sufficed to
reconcile him to the cruel dissection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Famous people, like obscure ones, do not weigh
every syllable they speak; and the former pay heavily
for imprudent utterance, whilst the latter sin scot-free
because nobody cares a straw what they say or
do not say. Tennyson, in an imprudent moment,
said once to Henry Irving that Shelley had no sense
of humour. It is quite true that Shelley had not: his
life would have been brighter and happier if he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>been able to laugh oftener; and it is exceedingly unfair
to Tennyson to twist this statement of an actual fact
into a depreciation of Shelley to his own self-praise.
Even if he implied that he were the greater poet of
the two, should a friend deride this, should a trusted
companion record it?</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Knowles relates how Tennyson, speaking of his
habit of composing verses which he never wrote down
as he sat over the winter’s fire, added, ‘How many
hundreds of fine lines went up the chimney and
vanished!’ The world cries out, ‘What! did he call
his own verses fine?’ Why should he not? He
must have known that he enriched the English
language with scores of fine lines, as I suppose he
must have known that he made many with false
quantities, which halt painfully. But are these careless,
natural phrases, utterances which should be
produced in print? Nothing can divest such <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>post-mortem</i></span>
revelations of a suspicion of treachery. They
suggest the note-book of the diplomatist, in which at
nightfall were recorded all the witty sayings and careless
confidences heard during the daytime.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Knowles, who admired Tennyson extremely,
and lived for many years in his close intimacy, puts
into print the saying of Tennyson that he wished he
could have had the money which his books had
brought without the nuisance of the fame which
accompanied it. This was not an heroic speech,
though it might be a natural one. It was probably
a wrathful ebullition excited by the irritation of
public comment and the prying impertinence of
public curiosity. But it is the kind of speech which
is never intended for reproduction in print. We all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>have these moments of ungrateful impatience with
our lot. The king wishes himself in the hovel, the
hind wishes himself on the throne. Whoso gathers
the laurel longs for the cowslip, he who has the field
flowers sighs for the myrtle and the bays. But it is
not the place of a bosom friend to stereotype for
all time the reproach of Fortune’s favourites to the
magnificent caprices of Fortune. Certainly Tennyson,
having been compelled to choose, would have chosen
the poverty and fame of Homer or of Cervantes rather
than a life of inglorious ease and obscure eating of
good dinners. The imperishable record in print, of
a passing mood of irritability in which he said otherwise,
is therefore a cruel injustice done to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible for the ordinary mind, which is
usually dense of perception and greedy of observation,
to attempt to measure or conceive in any degree the
unsupportable torment to a sensitive temper and an
exalted intelligence of the mosquito swarm of inquisitive
interrogators and commentators; of the exaggeration,
the misrepresentation, the offensive calumnies,
and the still more offensive admiration, which
are the daily penalty of all greatness. The adoring
American, perched staring in the pear tree outside
the dining-room window, may well have embittered
to Tennyson the meats and wines of his dinner-table
within. If he had got up from his table and shot the
spy, such a pardonable impulse should certainly have
been considered justifiable homicide. That because
a man has done something higher, better, more
beautiful than his fellows, he is therefore to be
subjected without resistance to their curiosity and
comment, is a premiss so intolerable that it should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>not be permitted to be advanced in any decent
society. The interviewer is the vilest spawn of the
most ill-bred age which the world has yet seen. If
he be received, when he intrudes, with the toe of the
boot, he has but his fitting reception.</p>

<p class='c001'>There has been lately published the following
personal description of a great writer whom I will
not especially designate. It runs as follows: ‘The
first impression one gets is of a small man with large
feet, walking as if for a wager, arms swinging hither
and thither, and fingers briskly playing imaginary
tunes in the air as he goes. Then, as the eccentric
shape comes nearer, one is aware of a stubby beard
and peeping eyes expressive of mingled distrust and
aversion; a hideous hat is clapped down on the broad
brow, which hat, when lifted, displays a bald expanse
of skull bearing no sort of resemblance whatever to
the counterfeit (<i>sic</i>) presentiments of Apollo; and
yet, incongruous though it seems, this little vacuous,
impatient, querulous being is no other than—’ And
then there is named one of the greatest masters of
language whom the world has ever owned.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet who, having read this infamous portrait of
physical defects, whether it be truth or libel, can ever
again entirely divest his memory of it, can ever
wholly prevent its arising in odious ridicule between
him and his rapturous sense of the perfect music of a
great style? Shakespeare cursed those who would
not let his bones alone; the living genius may with
equal justice curse those who will not let alone his
living form and features. There are only two classes
of persons who may be certain of seeing every
physical fault or deformity or affliction in face or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>form brutally written down in print: they are the
man of genius in the reports of his contemporaries,
and the escaped criminal on the handbills and search-warrants
of the police. Renan and Arton receive
exactly the same measure.</p>

<p class='c001'>The vulgar, the Herr Omnes of Luther, cannot
comprehend the hatred, the loathing of observation
and comment, which are of the very essence of the
poetic temperament. Yet it is strange to think that
being mobbed can be agreeable to anyone. The
sense of being pursued by incessant curiosity, as often
as not a merely malignant curiosity, must poison the
hours of life to the proud and sensitive nature. Such
curiosity existed, no doubt, in the days of Ovid, in
the days of Alkibiades; but modern inquisitiveness
is far worse, being armed with all the modern powers
to torture. The intolerable Kodak, the intolerable
interviewer, the artifices of the press, the typewriter,
the telegraph, the telephone, the greedy, indelicate,
omnivorous mind of the modern public—all contribute
to make of celebrity a Gehenna.</p>

<p class='c001'>Creation is the paradise of the artist or poet;
sympathy, if it be also true, is balm to him; for the
opinion of others he will never greatly care if his lips
have been truly touched with the coal from the altar,
yet the sense of his influence over them will be welcome
to him; but the espionage of the multitude will
be always to him irritating as mosquito bites, pestilent
as a swarm of termites, darkening like a locust flight
the face of the sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is hard to think that one who has an illustrious
name cannot idly gossip with an intimate friend
without every careless word being stereotyped. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>is grateful to Mr Knowles for telling us that Tennyson
declared he would shake his fists in the face of
Almighty God if He, etc., etc. One rejoices to know
of this outburst of honest indignation at the unpitied
sufferings of the helpless and the harmless, this grand
flinging of the phylacteries in the face of a hypocritical
and egotistic world. At the same time it is
surely impossible to admit that such a spontaneous
and impassioned expression of emotion ought, by
any hearer of it, to have been, in cold blood, put on
record and produced in print?</p>

<p class='c001'>Poor dead singer of Ida and Œnone! The ruthless
inquisitors who poisoned his life still pursue him
even beyond the cold waters of the Styx! There
is something infinitely pathetic in the knowledge of
how, all his life long, Tennyson endeavoured to avoid
the intrusion of the crowd, and of how utterly useless
all his wishes and endeavours were, and how those
whom he trusted and confided in, bring out the dead
children of his spoken thoughts naked in the sight
of the multitude whom he shunned.</p>

<p class='c001'>The confidential utterances of great men and
women should no more be desecrated by being told
to the public than tears and kisses should be profaned
by the publicity of a railway station.</p>

<p class='c001'>The general reader can no more understand
why Tennyson suffered so intensely at seeing a
chestnut tree felled in full flower than they can
understand the course in the heavens of Argol or
Altair. To spread out before them these delicate,
intricate, bleeding fibres of the soul is to slay Pegasus
and Philomel to make a workhouse meal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Knowles alleges that it is necessary for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and other intimate friends of Tennyson to say all
they thought of him, and repeat all he said, because
a similar record of Shakespeare’s conversations would
be so precious a treasure to the world. This, also,
is a questionable premiss. Shakespeare, happy in so
much, was happiest of all in the obscurity in which
his personality is sheltered; and the world is to be
congratulated that it knows too little of the man to
squabble and dwarf and disfigure him to the
detriment of his works, as it does Byron and Shelley.
What the man is matters so little. Psychology is
but another name for curiosity, envy, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dénigremené</i></span>.
Whether the orchid grow on a rotten tree, or the lily
on a dunghill, affects not the beauty of the orchid or
the fragrance of the lily. What Horace was, or was
not, at the Augustan Court cannot touch the exquisite
grace of his style, the lovely lines of his pictures in
words. The more we look at any writer the less we
are likely to do justice to his creations, because his
personality will exercise upon us either a great
attraction or a great repulsion. It would be better
for all works if, like Cologne Cathedral, they were
without known progenitors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could Dante Rossetti ever have dreamed that Mr
Leyland would preserve the poor, pathetic little note
asking for the gift of more wine in his last illness,
which Mr Val. Prinsep saw fit to publish in the <cite>Art
Journal</cite> of September 1892? If we may not trust
our most intimate friends with our necessities, in
whom can we confide? The whole of this aforesaid
correspondence of Rossetti was never intended for, nor
is it fitted for, publication. The general world has a
right to see any artist’s completed work, and judge it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>as they may choose to do, but they have no right to
be made acquainted with the hesitations, the self-torment,
the fluctations, the depression, the exultation,
which preceded its birth. These are the
ecstasies and the agonies which precede all gestation
and parturition, and are not for public exhibition.
Mr Leyland, loving Rossetti well, should have burned
all these letters before, or immediately after, the
artist’s death. Mr Leyland was a man who knew his
generation, and must have known the use which
would be made of them. If a friend grant me a
favour, and afterwards blab of that favour to our
common acquaintances, I should prefer that such a
favour had never been accorded. I think that most
people will agree with this feeling. Yet reticence
concerning favours done is not common in our times.
Such reticence ought to be held the simplest obligation
of honour; but the majority of persons do not so
regard it. There is hardly a letter of any length ever
written in which there are not some sentences liable
to misconstruction, or open to various readings. It
is grossly unfair to place any letter before those who
are not in the possession of its key; that key which
can alone lie in an intimate knowledge of its writer’s
circumstances and temperament. If Rossetti were
not rich enough to buy the wine he wanted in his
weakness, the shame is not his, but that of the world
which left him poor. To think that he was too poor
even to ever see Italy is an intolerable disgrace to his
contemporaries. He would have been wiser to have
left his patrons and to have lived in Italy on a black
crust and a plate of bean soup.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the man of genius amass wealth, he is accused of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>avarice or of mercenary sale of his own talent. If he
remain poor, or be in trouble, no language can
sufficiently condemn his extravagance, his improvidence,
his immorality. If he live with any kind of
splendour, it is display and profligacy; if he endeavour
to avoid remark, it is meanness, hauteur or
poverty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men and women of genius when they have money
are too generous with it, and when they have it not
are too careless about the lack of it. Shakespeare,
we are told, had the prudence to put his money together
and to buy houses and lands, with shrewd eye
to the main chance; but this is, after all, mere supposition
on the part of posterity. We know so little
of the circumstances of his life that, for aught we can
tell, he may have had some sharp-eyed, true-hearted
friend or factor, who thus transmuted the poet’s loose
coins into solid fields and freeholds, as George Eliot
had behind her George Lewis. I cannot believe that
Titania’s laureate ever quarrelled over deeds of copyhold
and questions of fees and betterments with the
burgesses and notaries of Stratford-upon-Avon.
More likely, far, that he was lying in the sun,
dreaming, deep cradled in cowslips and ladysmocks,
as his winged verses flew up with the bees into the
budding lime boughs overhead, whilst some trusty
friend or brother did battle in his name with the
chafferers and the scriveners in the little town. And
when all was settled, and the deeds of transfer only
wanted signature and seal, that trusty go-between
would shout across the meadows to waken Will from
his day-dream, and Will would lazily arise and come
across the grass, with the pollen of the bees and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>fragrant yellow dust of the cowslips on his clothes,
and, with his sweet, serene smile, would scrawl his
name to parchments which he scarcely even read.
That is, I would take my oath, how the stores of
Shakespeare increased, and how New Place became
his. Pembroke’s friend and Rosalind’s creator never
cared much for lucre, I am sure; for land he might
care, because he loved England: he loved her fields,
her woods, her streams, and he saw them as her sons
can never see them now, uninjured and undimmed,
the Lenten lilies growing tall beneath the untrimmed
hedges of hazel and hawthorn, the water meadows
spreading broad and fair, without a curl of smoke in
sight, save that which rose from the cottage hearths.
Elizabethan England was meadow where it was not
coppice, park where it was not forest, heathery moorland
where it was not reedy mere. It was natural
that Shakespeare should care to call his own some
portion of that beautiful leafy kingdom of his
birth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even so Scott loved his Scottish soil, and Tennyson
cared to own Farringford and Hazelmere. Even so
George Sand’s last dying words were of the trees of
Nohant. Passion and pleasure and fame and love were
in those last moments naught to her, but the green,
fresh, dewy leafage of dead summers was still dear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The psychologist Lombroso, in a recent essay,
which must fill the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bourgeois</i></span> breast with exultation,
finding that it is not possible for him to deny
the mental fecundity of genius, denies its physical
fertility, and endeavours to prove his assertion, after
the customary method of scientists, by avoiding
and omitting every fact which would in any manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>tell against his theory. Evidence when manipulated
by the scientist is like the colt when it issues, docked
and clipped, from its training stable. Laying down
the proposition that precocity is atavistic, founded on
the declaration of the biologist, Dr Delaunay, that it is
a sign of inferiority, he cites the marvellous precocity
of Raffaelle, Pascal, Mozart, Victor Hugo, Mirabeau,
Dante, Handel, Calderon, Tasso, and many others,
who prove, on the contrary, that precocity is the
sign of splendour, strength and durability of genius.
He remarks that precocity is a mark of insignificance,
and that the small and low organism develops with
much greater rapidity than the higher order! Were
we not used to the pompous self-contradictions of
Science, we should be surprised to see a characteristic
of so many great minds pronounced to be a defect
and a deformity; it is certainly only a scientist who
would dream of classing Raffaelle, Dante, Mozart,
Hugo, amongst the lesser organisms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole argument is built on the same quagmire
of illogical assertion and false deduction. He first lays
down as an axiom that men of genius are physically
sterile, and supports it by the strange and curiously
incorrect assertion that Shakespeare and Milton had
no posterity! He proceeds to quote the saying of
La Bruyère: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Ces hommes n’ont ni ancêtres ni postérités;
ils forment eux-seuls toute une descendance.’</span>
Now, as regards ancestry, it is clear that La Bruyère
spoke figuratively: he did not and could not mean
that men of genius have no progenitors: he meant
that who their progenitors were did not matter to the
world which cared only for themselves; in a similar
way he spoke of their descendants, not as actually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>non-existent, but as counting for nothing beside the
superior creation of their works.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amongst the sterile <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>célibataires</i></span> Lombroso oddly
enough includes Voltaire and Alfieri, whose loves and
liaisons were famous and numerous. He entirely
ignores Victor Hugo, whose philoprogenitiveness was
so excessive as to be absurd; the extreme affection
for their offspring of Tennyson and Renan, of George
Sand and of Juliette Adam, of Millias and of Meissonier,
of Mario and of Grisi, and of countless others
whose names are famous and whose affections were
or are most ardent. The offspring publicly recognised
by man or woman is by no means necessarily the sole
offspring of either. Allegra is not mentioned beside
Ada in Burke’s Peerage. Natural children frequently
are not allowed to know even their own parentage; a
woman may have children whom she does not openly
acknowledge; a man may have children of whose
birth even he knows nothing. It is not every celebrated
woman who has the maternal courage of
George Sand, nor every celebrated man who has the
paternal tenderness of Shelley.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lombroso confuses in a most unscientific manner
the passion of love and the bond of marriage. Because
Michael Angelo says that art is wife enough for him,
Lombroso supposes that no passion, good or evil, ever
moved him. The fact that a man or woman has not
married does not prove that they have had no amours:
the probability is that their ardour and caprice in love
have withheld them from the captivity of a legal union,
which is usually the tomb of love. Everything which
disturbs the odd conclusion to which it has pleased him
to come is put aside and left out by a writer whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>treatise pretends to be based on an inexorable accuracy.
He carefully omits all reference to the men of
old who would, almost without exception, disprove
his theory. The three greatest of these are surely
Mahomet, Alexander and Julius Cæsar: all this triad
were famous for sensual indulgence almost without
limit. So far as the fact may be considered to honour
genius, its alliance with the joys of voluptuous
passions is fully established, and no ingenuity in
paradox of a perverse hater of it can contravene the
fact. As for the poets, from Catullus to Burns, they
rise in their graves and laugh in the face of the
biologist. Sterile? They? As well call sterile the
red clover which yields its fecundating pollen to the
bee in the glad sunlight of a summer day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great singer called Mario was a man of genius
in every way, apart from the art in which he was unsurpassed:
yet, he was a singularly handsome man,
and possessed of magical seduction for women. Of
the Spanish poet Zorilla, for whose recent death all
Spanish women wept, the same may be said. Longfellow
was very handsome, and his life was lovely,
noble, and harmonious, from his youth to his grave.
The physical beauty of Washington is well known,
yet his genius cannot be contested. Vandyke had
extreme physical beauty; Raffaelle also; the painters
have nearly always been conspicuous for personal
beauty, from Leonardo to Millais and Leighton.
Gladstone has very fine features and a magnificent
constitution; his physical strength is wonderful, yet
his intellect has always been at full stretch, like a
racing greyhound. The personal beauty and fine
stature of Tennyson were accompanied by the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>keen intellectual ardour, extant until the very latest
day of his life. The beauty of Milton and of Goethe
has become traditional in their respective countries.
Wellington and Marlborough were singularly handsome
men. Napoleon was a man of short stature, but
his face had a classic beauty which resisted even death,
as may be seen in the mask taken from his dead
features at St Helena. Take Lamartine; place his
verse where you will, it is impossible to deny his
genius, the genius of intense poetic sympathy and
insight, of eloquence, of magical music of utterance, of
comprehension of all creatures which live and suffer;
he himself was his finest poem, and as to his wonderful
physical beauty there can be no dispute. Of three
typical men of genius of modern times take Shakespeare,
Goethe and Henri Quatre; all were of much
beauty of person, and masculine vigour was not lacking
in any; in the two latter it was even excessive.
The hero of Arques and Ivry was the lover of more
fair women than peopled the harem of Sardanapalus.
Yet he had supreme genius; the genius of command,
of wit, of intuition, of magnetic charm over the minds
and wills and hearts of men; a charm which has been
stronger than death, and has kept the fascination of
his memory green throughout the length and breadth
of France. Many more similar examples might be
quoted. These, however, suffice to prove the inexactitude
of the envious calumnies cast upon genius by
Lombroso, who actually asserts that genius is never
separated from physical degeneracy, and that the
splendour of the brain is always paid for by atrophy
of other organs! Were this true, the wretched, deformed,
stunted creatures, the arrest of whose physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>development is artificially obtained by the most cruel
torture, and constitutes a trade in the Cevennes and
the Pyrenees, would all of them become Napoleons,
Goethes, Byrons, Mussets, Racines and Bismarcks.
The manufacture of cripples would be the manufacture
of heroes and poets! The favourite theory of
scientists that genius is <em>caused</em> by physical imperfection
is manifestly untrue, and grossly calumnious. It
means, if it means anything, that the physically imperfect
creature is the intellectually perfect; that the
scrofulous and hunchbacked dwarf is the light-giver of
the world, the Apollo Citharædus of the arts. What
facts bear out such a theory?</p>

<p class='c001'>Equally calumnious and false is the conclusion by
Lombroso, that the man of genius (like the madman)
is born, lives and dies, <em>cold</em>, <em>solitary</em>, <em>invisible</em>. A more
abominable libel was never penned by mediocrity on
greatness. The sweet, bright humour of Scott, buoyant
even beneath woe and bodily pain; the gay, delightful
kindliness of Molière, the cheerful, serene
philosophies of Montaigne, the superb resistance to
calamity of Cervantes, the playful, indulgent, affectionate
temper of Thackeray, the noble tranquillity in
adversity of Milton, the happy whimsical humour of
Horace, the calm and fruitful leisure of Suetonius, the
adoration of Nature of all the poets, from Theocritus
to Lecomte de Lisle—all these and a thousand others
arise to memory in refutation of this ignoble libel.

<p class='c014'>Victor Hugo: the master of one of the most fertile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>puissant and imaginative minds ever known on earth.
That genius seeks solitude is natural: it is only the
fool who is afraid of his own company; the meditations
and intellectual memories of genius must
always be more delightful to it than the babble of
society.</p>

<p class='c001'>The commerce and conversation of the majority of
persons is wearisome, trivial, dull; it is not wonderful
that one who can commune in full harmony of thought
with Nature, and with the wisdom of old, turns from
the common babble of the common herd, and seeks
the shelter of the library, or the silence of the forest
and the moor. But such an one will always give
more human sympathy than he can ever receive.
None can see into his soul; but the souls of others
are laid bare to him. To others he is a mystery
which they fear; but others are to him as children
whom he pities. If their folly and deadness of heart
arouse his scorn, he yet weeps for them, because they
know not what they do. They cannot hear, as he
hears, the sigh in the leaves of the fallen tree, the
woe in the cry of the widowed bird, the voices of the
buried nations calling from the unseen tombs: no, in
that sense he is alone, as the seer is alone and the
prophet; but this loneliness comes not from the coldness
of his own heart, but from the poverty of the
hearts of other men. Who dares to say that those
who alone can put into speech the emotions of a
humanity, in itself dumb and helpless, are incapable
of feeling those emotions which without them would
find neither utterance nor interpreter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lombroso speaks exultingly of the cruelty to
women of Musset, Byron, Carlyle and others; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>has evidently no conception of the intense irritation
roused in sensitive natures by uncongenial and
enforced companionship. Jane Carlyle was a woman
of fine wit and character, but she had no tact and
little patience, and her sharp retorts must have been
as thorns in the flesh of her bilious and melancholy
Saul, as his uncouthness and ill-breeding must have
been cruel trials to her. But this was no fault of
either of them: it was the fault of that sad mistake,
so common in the world, of an ill-assorted marriage,
in which the prisoners suffered only the more because
they were, in their different ways, of fine character,
with a sense of duty so acute in each that it was a
torture to both alike. What Lombroso calls the
brutality of Carlyle was probably little else than the
morbid gloom caused by a diseased liver, this disease
in turn caused by the constraint and asphyxiation of
a town life in a small house to a man born of hardy,
outdoor, rustic stock, and farmed to breathe the
strong, keen air of solitary Scottish moors and hills,
to be braced by storm and sunshine, to battle with
snow and wind and rain. The terrible folly which
drives men of talent into cities, and leave them only
the vitiated air of close and crowded streets, of
feverish gatherings, and of unhealthy club-houses, is
the origin of that alliance, so often seen in the present
age, between the gifted mind and the suffering body,
or the restless nerves, of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>névrosé</i></span>, of a hypochondriac,
or of a bilious diabetic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lombroso, in the malignant spitefulness with which
the scientists throw mud and stones at all genius,
calls Byron a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Rachitique</i></span>, on account of his deformed
foot; but when we remember Byron’s splendid swimming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>powers, his endurance in the saddle, his passion
for the mountains and the sea, his heroic calmness on
his lonely deathbed, we must, if we are sincere, admit
that this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Rachitique</i></span>, even apart from all his superb
genius, was a man of no common courage and no
common force, and that, whatever might be at birth
the physical weakness accompanying his great physical
beauty, he had known how to make himself the
equal of the strongest even in outdoor sports. When
we think of that great beauty before which women
went down as corn before the flash of the reaping-hook,
of the incomparable romance of that life, passing
from the crowds of St James’s to the pine solitudes
of Ravenna, from the adulation of Courts to the
silence of Alp and ocean, from the darksome glens
and braes of Scotland to the azure light on the
Hellespont and the Adrian Sea—when we think of
its marvellous compass brought within the short span
of thirty-six years, of its god-like powers, of its surpassing
gifts, of its splendour of song, of wit, of
melody, of passion, and of inspiration, of its tragic
close, which broke off the laurel bough in its green
prime, as Apollo would have it broken—when we
think of this life, I say, it is easy to understand why
its effulgence has been the mark for every petty
malignity and jealous mediocrity ever since the light
of the sun died down at Missolonghi.</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron’s must ever remain the most ideal, the most
splendid, the most varied life which ever incarnated in
itself the genius of man and the gifts of the gods: what
joy, then, to the petty and the envious to point to his
club foot, and to assure us he was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Rachitique</i></span>! The
puling versifiers who spend their lifetime in elaborating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>artificial sonnets based on early Italian methods,
straining, refining, paring, altering, transforming, trying
to replace by effort all which is lacking to them
in inspiration, may well be unable to comprehend
aught of that fiery fury of scorn and invective, of
that Niagara-like rush of thought and word and
imagery, which made verse as natural an utterance to
Byron as the torrent of its song is natural to the
nightingale in the months of spring. To the grand
verse of Byron there may be rivals, there may be
superiors; but to the poetry of his life there is no
equal in any other life. What greater, more unpardonable
sin can he have in the sight of mediocrity?</p>

<p class='c001'>I lately saw a tourist of small stature, mean appearance,
and awkward gesture, criticising unfavourably
the attitude of the beautiful Mercury in the Vatican
Rotonda. I was irresistibly reminded of certain versifiers
and newspaper essayists of the present moment
criticising Byron!</p>

<p class='c001'>Lombroso asserts that ‘the man of genius has only
contempt for other men of genius; he is offended by
all praise not given to himself; the dominant feeling
of a man of genius, or even of erudition, is hatred and
scorn for all other men who possess, or approach the
possession of genius or talent.’ A greater libel was
never penned. It is natural that those who are
masters of their art should be less easy to please, less
ignorant of its demands and beauties, than the crowd
can be. The great writer, the great artist, the great
composer, can scarcely fail to feel some disdain for
the facility with which the public is satisfied, the
fatuity with which it accepts the commonplace, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>second-rate, the imitation, the mere catch-penny, as
true and original creation. But this scorn for the
mediocre, which is inseparable from all originality
and is its right and privilege, does not for a moment
preclude the ardent sympathy, the joyous recognition
with which genius will salute the presence of kindred
genius. What of the friendship of Coleridge and
Wordsworth, of Byron and Shelley, of Flaubert and
George Sand, of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson?
Scarce a year ago two illustrious men conversed with
sympathy and friendship under the green leaves by
the waters of Annecy. Philippe Berthelet narrates
how <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘sous les vieux noyers de Talloires ils discutèrent
pour la première fois de leur vie, Renan défendant son
cher Lamartine, et Taine son poëte préféré Musset;
je garde un pieux souvenir des nobles paroles de ces
deux grands hommes qu’il m’a été donné d’entendre
ce soir de Septembre sur le bord du lac limpide, au
pied de la Tournette couronnée de neiges.’</span></p>

<p class='c001'>The public likes inferior production; as a rule prefers
it, because it understands it more easily; and
this preference may irritate the supreme artist into a
burst of wrath. Berlioz gave the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Damnation de Faust</cite></span>
to empty benches, and his Titanic disdain of his contemporaries
for their preference of weaker men has
been justified by the verdict of the present generation.
But this sentiment of scorn is as far removed from
the petty malignity of envy and injustice as the fury
of the tempest amongst the Alps or Andes is unlike
the sputtering of a candle guttering in a tin sconce.
To the poet to see the poetaster crowned; to the great
man to see his miserable imitator accepted as his
equal; to the planet on high to know that the street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>lamp below is thought his rival, must ever be offensive.
But this offence is just, and has grandeur in it;
it is no more meanness and jealousy than the planet
is the gaspipe or the Alpine storm the candle.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the great artist it is a great affront to see the
imitator of himself, the thief, the dauber, the mimic,
the mediocre, accepted as an artist by the world. He
is entitled to resent the affront and to scourge the
offender. The intolerance of genius for mediocrity
is called unkindness: it is no more unkind than the
sentence of the judge on the criminal. In our time
the material facilities given to production have multiplied
mediocrity as heat multiplies carrion flies; it
should have no quarter shown to it; it is a ravaging
pest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cheap printing makes writers of thousands who
would be more fittingly employed in stitching shoes
or digging ditches; and the assistance of photography
makes painters or draughtsmen of thousands who
would be more harmlessly occupied whitewashing
sheds or carding wool. Genius is as rare as ever it
was in all the arts; but the impudent pretensions of
nullity to replace and represent it increase with every
year, because it finds readier acceptance from the
ever-increasing ignorance of a universally educated
public. The men of genius who do exist do not say
this loudly enough or often enough: they are afraid
to look unkind and to create enemies. It is not excellence
which is malignant, envious, slanderous,
mean: it is inferiority; inferiority dressed in the
cheap garment of ill-fitting success.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a draughtsman who is very eminent in our
time, and whose drawings have brought him in alike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>celebrity and wealth. He is esteemed one of the
first artists in black-and-white of the century. Yet
he never draws a line of any figure without resorting
to his immense collection of photographs of all kinds
and conditions of persons, in all attitudes and in all
costumes, whence he selects whatever he may want
to reproduce. This habit may perhaps not impair
his skill as a draughtsman; but it certainly makes
him a mere imitator, a mere copyist, and robs his
works of all spontaneity, originality and sincerity.
To draw from a photograph is mere copying, mere
cheating; it is not art at all. Yet this popular
draughtsman has not the least shame or hesitation
in avowing his methods; nor do his public or his
critics appear to see anything to censure or regret in
them. If the true artist, who is sincere and original
in all his creations, who draws from life, and would
no more employ a camera than he would pick a
pocket, feels, and expresses the contempt which he
feels, for the draughtsman who is dependent on
photographs, he is not moved either by hostility or
jealousy, but by a wholesome and most just disdain.
It is a disdain with which the general public can
have little sympathy, because they cannot estimate
the quality of the offence which excites it.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the creator, whether of prose, of poem, of
melody, picture, or statue, who is sincere in all he
creates, to whom conscious imitation would have all
the baseness of a forgery, and to whom sincerity and
originality are the essence of creative talent, the fraud
of imitation disgusts and offends as it cannot do the
mere outsider. Such disgust, such offence, are no
more envy or jealousy than the sublime fury of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>storming-party is the secret stabbing of the hired
bravo.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh, the obscure! the vile obscure! what shafts
dipped in gall will they not let fly from the dusky
parlour in which they sit and look with envious scowl
out on the distant splendour of great lives!</p>

<p class='c001'>The sweetest singer who ever sang on the classic
Tyrrhene shore—Shelley, who soared with the skylark
and suffered with the demi-god—Shelley leaves
unhappily behind him a piteous little letter telling his
friend Williams, in Dublin, of his poverty, and asking
for the loan of five-and-twenty pounds; and this poor
little letter is basely preserved and is sold by auction
in London in the month of March of last year for the
sum of eleven sovereigns! <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>O beati insipientes!</i></span> who
cares whether you borrow five-and-twenty pounds, or
five-and-twenty pence, or five-and-twenty thousand?
Who cares to keep your humble request, your timid
confession? Who cares whether you got what you
craved, or were left to die of hunger? You, the
mediocre, the commonplace, the incapable, are left in
peace; but the sorry, carking, humiliating need of the
beautiful boy-singer, whose name is blessed for all
time, is dragged into the auction-mart and bid for
rabidly by the curious! What joy for you, you well-fed,
broad-bellied, full-pursed hordes of the commonplace,
to think that this sensitive plant shivered and
sickened under the vulgar hand of dun and bailiff,
and withered in the sandy waste of want! He could
write down the music of the lark, and hear the
laughter of the fairies, and paint the changing glories
of the sea, and suffer with the fallen Titan as with the
trodden flower—but he was once in sore need of five-and-twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>pounds! <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>O beati insipientes!</i></span> Here lie
your triumphs and your revenge. Clasp your fat
palms above your ample paunch, and grin as you
embrace your banker’s pass-book. Take heed to
keep that little letter of the poet of the ‘Prometheus’
safe under glass for all time, to comfort the jealous
pains of the millions of nonentities whom you will
continue to procreate until the end of time! Such
are the consolations of inferiority.</p>

<p class='c001'>Genius offends by its unlikeness to the general; it
scorns their delights, their views, their creeds, their
aspirations; it is at once much simpler and much
more profound than they; it suffices to itself in a
manner which, to the multitude, seems arrogance;
the impersonal is always much more absorbing to it
than the personal; there are qualities in it at once
childlike and godlike, which offend the crowd at once
by their ignorance and by their wisdom. In a word,
it is apart from them; and they know that, they feel
that, and they cannot forgive its unlikeness.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>O Beati Insipientes!</i></span> Unwatched, you eat and
drink and work and play; unchronicled are your
errors and your follies; would you weep, you may

spy, notebook in hand, will lurk in the hedges; when
you pour out your trivial nonsense in the ear of a
friend, he will not treasure it up to turn it into
printer’s copy as soon as you shall be cold in your
coffin.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>O Beati Insipientes!</i></span> You know not what safety,
what peace, what comfort are gained for you by your

fame is darkened for ever to those whose path lies
through it by the shadow which follows, mimicking,
prying, listening, grinning, girding, slobbering, eagerly
watching for a false step, cruelly counting the thorns
trodden amidst the flowers—that shadow which dogs
without mercy the whole of a life, and thrusts its prying
fingers through the cere-clothes of death, that
shadow of merciless and malign curiosity which
follows genius as the assassin followed the fair youth
Crichton through the streets of Mantua: the crime
of Crichton being to excel!</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CITIES OF ITALY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>Whatever may be the opinion of Europe as
to the political advantages accruing to it
from the independence of Italy, it must be mournfully
confessed that the losses to art and to history through
it are greater than any which could have been caused
by centuries of neglect or long years of hostile occupation
and devastating war. It is scarcely to be
measured, indeed, what those losses are; so immense
are they in their extent, so incessant in their exercise,
so terrible in their irreparable infamy. No doubt it
could never be foreseen, never be imagined, by those
who brought about and permitted the consolidation
of Italy into one kingdom, that the people, nominally
free, would become the abject slaves of a municipal
despotism and of a barbarous civic greed. None of
the enthusiasts for Italian independence possessed
that power of foresight which would have told them
that its issue would be the daily destruction, by
hordes of foreign workmen, of its treasures of art
and its landmarks of history. Yet there is no exaggeration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>in saying that this, and nothing less than
this, is its chief issue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hermann Grimm published a powerful appeal
to the scholars and artists of Europe against the
Italian destruction of Rome. Having for thirty
years written on Italian cities and their art and
history, with scholarship and devotion, he had gained
the right to raise his voice in indignant protest and
scorn against the mercenary and vulgar shamelessness
with which the Roman municipality is so dealing
with the splendid heritage which it has received, that
soon scarcely one stone will be left upon another of
the sacred city. He said, and with truth, that the
portion of the Italian nation which has the eyes to
perceive and the soul to abhor all that is being done
is so small a minority, and one so spiritless, hopeless
and discouraged, that it is for all practical purposes
non-existent. He appealed to what he termed that
larger Rome which exists in the hearts of all who
have ever known Rome with a scholar’s knowledge,
or an artist’s love. The appeal may be powerless
but at least it may be heard; and though it will
scarcely be able to pierce through the thick hide of smug
vanity and rapacity in which Italian municipalities
are enveloped, it will put on record the courage and
the scorn of one man for what is the greatest artistic
iniquity of our time. It is idle and untrue for Italians
to say that the rest of Europe has no right to interfere
with what they do with the legacy they enjoy. In
the first place, without the aid and acquiescence of
Europe, the Italian kingdom as a unity could never
have existed at all; without the permission of Europe
the entry into Rome could never have been made at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>all. Europe has the title to observe and to condemn
the manner in which the superb gift, which she permitted
to be given to those very various peoples who
are called Italians, is being squandered away and
destroyed. The United Kingdom of Italy may, as a
political fact, disappear to-morrow in any European
war or any great Socialistic uprising; but historic
Italy, classic Italy, artistic Italy, is a treasure which
belongs to the whole world of culture, in which,
indeed, the foreigner, if he be reverent of her soil, is
far more truly her son than those born of her blood
who violate her and desecrate her altars. Italy cannot
be narrowed to the petty bounds of a kingdom
created yesterday; she has been the mistress of all
art, the muse and the priestess of all peoples.</p>

<p class='c001'>What are the Italians doing with her? It is sickening
to note and to record. Nothing can ever give
back to the world what, day by day, municipal
councillors having houses to sell, syndicates and
companies merely looking for spoliation and speculation,
contractors who seize on the land as a trooper
seizes on a girl in a sacked town, are all taking from
the fairest and the most ancient cities and towns on
earth. The sound of the hatchet in the woods and
gardens of Italy is incessantly echoed by the sound
of the pickaxe and hammer in the cities and towns.
The crash of falling trees is answered by the crash of
falling marbles. All over the land, destruction, of the
vilest and most vulgar kind, is at work; destruction
before which the more excusable and more virile
destruction of war looks almost noble. For the
present destruction has no other motive, object, or
mainspring than the lowest greed. It is absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>incomprehensible how, after having been the leaders
and the light of the far centuries, the Italians have,
by common consent and with pitiable self-congratulation,
sunk to the position of the most benighted
barbarism in art. In everything which is now constructed
the worst and most offensive taste is manifest,
whilst that which has existed for centuries is attacked
and pulled down without remorse. I wholly fail to
account, on any philosophic or psychological grounds,
for the utter deadness of soul which has come on the
Italians as a nation. Born with loveliness of all kinds,
natural and architectural, around them, the æsthetic
sense should be as instinctive in them as their movements
of limbs or lungs. Instead of this, it is entirely
gone out of them. They have no feeling for colour, no
sense of symmetry, and little or no sense of reverence
for the greatness and the gloriousness of the past.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only people in whom any of the native feeling
for natural and artistic beauty still exists are those
country people who dwell far removed from the
contagion of the towns, and the marine populations of
the Veneto. But even in these it is slighter than any
student of the past would expect. The sense of
colour is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span> in most Italians; they might as well be
colour-blind for any heed they take of harmony of
tones. They delight in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chinoiseries</i></span>, in photographs,
in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crétonnes</span>, in all the rubbish bought in modern
Exhibitions. In the superb and immense halls of a
palace of the Renaissance one will see priceless
tapestries on the walls, antique marbles on the
consoles, frescoes of Veronese, of Giulio Romano, or
of Sodoma on the ceilings; and at the same time see
arm-chairs and couches, some yellow, some blue, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>green, some scarlet; a table-cover of crimson; and
the mosaic floor covered with a worthless <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>moquette</i></span>
carpet of all hues, and of a set and staring pattern. I
call to mind a similar palace on the Tiber, whose very
name is as a trumpet-call to all the glories of the
past; there the antique statues have been coloured,
‘because white marble is so cold and sad;’ an admirable
copy in bronze of the Mercury of Gian’ di Bologna
has had his wings, his petasus, and his caduceus gilded;
and the marble floors have been taken up to have
French parquet flooring laid down in their stead, and
varnished so highly that the woods glisten like looking-glasses;
yet the owner of and dweller in this place is a
great noble, who, after his own fashion, cherishes art.
I have seen a Greek Venus, found in the soil at Baiæ,
wreathed round with innumerable yards of rose-coloured
gauze by its owner, an Italian princess.
The excuse given is, ‘<i>Senza un’po di tinta sta cosi
fredda!</i>’</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the same feeling which makes the Italian
peasant say of the field-flowers which you have
arranged in your rooms, ‘How well you have made
those vulgar weeds look! Any one would take them
now for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>fiori secchi</i></span>!’ (artificial flowers). Whence
comes it, this absolute blindness of the eyes, this
deadening absence of all consciousness of beauty?
It is the same thing in their villages and their fairs.
Go to a fair on a feast-day in any part of France; go
to a kermesse in Belgium or Luxembourg; go to a
merry-making in Germany or Austria, and you will
see a picturesque and graceful sight; you will see a
great deal of what the eyes of Teniers, of Ostade, of
Callot, of Mieris saw in their day. There will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>harmonised colours, unconscious grace of grouping,
arrangements of common goods and simple things so
made that beauty is got out of them. But in a
village festival in Italy there is nothing, except in the
water pageants of Venice, which is not ugly; it is all
dusty, uninteresting, untempting; what colours there
are, are arranged with the same disregard of fitness
as is shown in the yellow, red and green arm-chairs
of the palace chambers; and the whole effect is one
of squalor and of vulgarity. The carnivals, which
used to be fine and brilliant spectacles, are now, almost
all, save that of Milan, mere tawdry, trivial, unlovely
follies. Who can account for this?</p>

<p class='c001'>Are we to infer that all the transmitted influences
of race count for nothing? Would those who, rightly
or wrongly, are tempted to explain all the problems of
life by the doctrines of heredity tell me why the
living representatives of the most artistic races on
earth are almost absolutely deprived of all artistic
instincts? Some have suggested that it is the outcome
of the artificial habits and false taste of the
eighteenth century; but this can scarcely be correct,
because this artificiality existed all over Europe, not
in Italy alone, and besides, never touched the country
people in any way or in any of their habits.</p>

<p class='c001'>The excuse made for the utter disregard and
destruction of beauty in Italy is that the utility of all
things is now preferred to beauty. But this is no
adequate explanation. It may explain why a dirty
steamboat is allowed to grind against the water-steps
of the Ca’d’Oro, or why the fair shores of Poselippo
and the blue bays of Spezzia and Taranto are made
hideous by steam and bricks. But it will not explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>why the peasant thinks a wax or cambric flower more
lovely than a field anemone or daffodil, or why the
nobleman paints his Athene and gilds the wings of
his Hermes. This can only be traced to the utter
decay of all feeling for beauty, natural or artistic, in
the Italian mind, and, though we see, we cannot
adequately explain, we can only deplore, it. There is
no doubt a tendency all the world over to loss of the
true sense of beauty; despite the æsthetic pretences
of nations, the real feeling for natural and artistic
perfection is very weak in most of them. If it were
strong and pure, the utilitarian (<i>i.e.</i>, the money-getting
spirit) would not prevail as it does in architecture,
and forest solitudes would not be destroyed as they
are; and men would see what hypocrites they be
who make millions out of some hideous desecration of
nature by factories, iron foundries, or petroleum wells,
and think they can purchase condonation, and a
reputation for fine taste, by buying pictures for their
galleries or inlaying their halls with rare woods or
stones. The whole world which calls itself civilised
is guilty more or less of the most absolute barbarism;
but modern Italy is guiltiest of all, even as he who
has inherited a fair home and cultured intelligence is
guiltier than he who has never known anything but a
vitiated atmosphere and a squalid house. It is the
immensity of her heritage which makes her abuse of
all her opportunities so glaring and so utterly beyond
pardon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing can ever give back to mankind what every
day the Italian municipalities and people are destroying,
as indifferently as though they were pulling down
dead leaves or kicking aside anthills in the sand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>There is not even the pretext for these acts that they
are done to better the state of the people; to execute
them the cheapest foreign labour is called in, ousting
the men of the soil off it: house-rent is trebled and
quadrupled, house-room narrowed, and in many instances
denied, to the native population: and contracts
are given away right and left to any foreign
companies or syndicates who choose to bid for them.
The frightful blocks of new houses, the hideous new
streets, the filthy tramways, the naked new squares,
are all made by foreign speculators who purchase
the right of spoliation from the municipalities as
the private owners of the soil. A few men are
made temporarily richer: the country is permanently
beggared.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Rome’ wrote Hermann Grimm, ‘represents for
humanity a spiritual value which cannot be easily
estimated, but which is none the less precious because
ideal.’ Yet the vulgar and petty administration of an
ephemeral moment is allowed to treat the capital of
the world as though it were some settlement of
shanties in the backwoods of America, fit only to disappear
beneath the mallet and scaffolding of carpenters
and masons. He said with justice that to
call it vandalism is an injustice to the Vandals, for
they, at least, were too ignorant to know the worth of
what they destroyed, and acted in mere fierce instinct
of conquest, with no ulterior greed; but they who are
now destroying arch on arch, tower on tower, temple
and church and palace, piling the sacred stones one on
another like rubble, and effacing landmarks which
had been respected through a thousand years, have
the excuse neither of ignorance nor of war. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>know not what to do, and we may add that they care
not what they do, so long as their gain is made, their
pockets filled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all the grotesque barbarisms committed in Rome,
the destruction of the cloister of Ara Cœli and of the
tower of San Paolo upon the Capitol, to make room
for an equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel, has
been one of the most offensive and ill-judged. All
the world knows the beauty of the Capitol, the
immemorial memories connected with it, and the
great statue which for so many centuries has felt the
Roman sunshine strike on its golden bronze. The
placing of a modern statue in juxtaposition with the
mighty Aurelian is an act so irredeemably vulgar, so
pitiably incongruous, that it is a matter of infinite
regret, even for the repute of the House of Savoy, that
the present king did not peremptorily forbid such use
of his father’s manes. In the Superga, or on the
mountain-side of the Piedmontese Alps he loved so
well, a statue of Victor Emmanuel would be in keeping
with his traditions, but it is a cruelty to him to
dwarf him by such surroundings and such memories
as are there on the Capitol of Rome. His fame is
not of the kind which can bear, uninjured, such comparisons;
and were it even ten times greater than it is,
there could be no excuse for using the Capitol for such
a purpose when there is the whole width of the Campagna
for it, and when, in perfect accord with the
abilities of modern sculptors, there are all the staring
and naked modern piazzas waiting for their works.
Will it be credited that it was actually proposed to
place a statue of him between the columns of St
Mark? In these matters the king could and should,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>with perfect propriety, intervene, and forbid a pretended
homage for his father’s memory being made a
pretext and cover for the coarse and common vandalism
of the epoch. In Florence, the beautiful wooded
entrance of the Cascine was destroyed to make the
bald, uninteresting square called the Piazza degli
Zuavi, and a large, stony, open place, shadeless and
unlovely, was reserved for a monument to Victor
Emmanuel; for this the oval brick basement of the
pedestal was raised many years ago, and there stands,
unfinished and hideous, an eyesore to the city, an
insult to the royal House.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is scarcely a little town, there is no provincial
capital on the whole peninsula, which has not some
new, staring, stucco street named Corso Vittorio
Emmanuele, or some historic and ancient square made
absurd and pitiable by being re-baptised Piazza dell’
Independenza. The effect is at once ludicrous and
deplorable.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it were necessary thus to deify the events of the
last thirty years, and magnify them out of their true
proportions, it would have been easy to build some
wholly new city in some vacant spot, which might
have borne any name or names deemed fitting, and
thus have left in peace the great cities of the past, and
not have made the present recall the fable of the frog
and the bull.</p>

<p class='c001'>Around Rome, as well as within it, the most
luxuriant vegetation, a few years ago, alternated with
the most sacred ruins: tombs and temples and
triumphal arches were framed in the most abundant
foliage; the banksia rose, the orange, the myrtle, the
jessamine climbed and blossomed amidst the ruins of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the palace of the Cæsars. In all these grand gardens,
in these flowering fields, in these grass meadows,
stretching between their marble colonnades, there
was, as the German scholar says, an infinite calm, a
loveliness and stillness in which the poet and the
scholar could draw near to the mighty dead who had
once been there as living men. There was nothing
like it left on earth. Now it is destroyed for ever.
Now,—in the stead of that tender silence of the tombs,
that exquisite freshness of the spring, awakening in
a thousand moss-grown dells and myrtle thickets
which had seen Ovid and St Paul, Augustine and
Raffael--now, in the stead of this there are the stench
of engines, the dust of shattered bricks, the scream
of steam whistles, the mounds of rubbish, the poles of
scaffolding, long lines of houses raised in frantic
haste on malarious soil, enormous barracks, representative
of the martial law required to hold in check
a liberated people: all is dirt, noise, confusion,
hideousness, crowding, clamour, avarice.</p>

<p class='c001'>The leaders of an invading and victorious army
would have been ashamed to cause the havoc and
the blasphemy which the Roman municipality have
carried out with shameless callousness; the indignant
voice of Europe would have bidden a Suwarrow, a
Napoleon, a Constable de Bourbon stay his hand,
had he dared to level with the dust the august
monuments of which neither the majesty nor the
memories have power to daunt the impious hand of
the nineteenth century Edilizia. Common faith,
even, has not been kept with the Roman people
in the ruin of their city; the completed plan, put
before the public in 1880, of the works which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>intended, did not prepare the public for one-tenth of
the devastation which has been wrought. In the
words of Grimm, those who put forth the plan of ’80
proposed tranquil, moderate and decent measures,
and never contemplated the insensate haste, the
brutal fury, the unsparing greed shown by those who,
professing to accept its propositions, have utterly
disregarded and far outstripped them. In the plan
of ’80 it was, for instance, expressly stated and
provided that certain gardens, amongst them the
Ludovisi, should be purchased by the city, but kept
intact in their verdure and extent. This promise
has been broken.</p>

<p class='c001'>What traveller has not known the Ludovisi Gardens?
What scholar, dreamer, painter, has not found his
heaven there? Those immemorial pines, making twilight
beneath them in the sunniest noon, those lofty
walls of bays and of arbutus, those dim, green, shadowy
aisles leading to velvet swards and violet-studded banks,
the family of peacocks spreading their purples, their
emeralds, their gold, out in the glory of the radiant
light, the nightingales singing night and day in the
fragrant solitudes, Sappho’s angel in Corrinna’s
gardens—who has not known these? who has not
loved these? And they are gone, gone forever; gone
through the greed of men, and in their stead will
stand the vile rows of cheap and staring houses: in
their place will reign the devil of centralisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Centralisation is the heart-disease of nations. The
blood, driven by it from the body and the limbs,
becomes turgid and congested, overfills the vessels of
the heart, and chokes them up; there is no more
health, and later there is death. It has been the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>curse of France. It will be the curse of Italy.
The violated nymphs and the slaughtered nightingales
of the ruined gardens will be avenged. But what
solace is that to us? We have lost them forever.
No power on earth can give them back to us.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a violation of that sentiment which the
Latins called Piety, so glaring, and so monstrous, in
the destruction of Rome by the Italians, that it dwarfs
all similar ruin being wrought elsewhere. All over
Italy things are daily being done which might wring
tears from the statues’ eyes of stone.<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c015'><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>After the outrage to Rome, the injury done to
Venice is the most irreparable, the most inexcusable.</p>

<p class='c001'>The wanton destruction of the island of Saint
Elena is, after the destruction of the Ludovisi and
other historic gardens in Rome, the most disgraceful
act of the sacrilege of modern Italy. It is barbarism
without one shadow of excuse or plea of obligation.
This loveliest isle had been spared by all hostile fleets
and armies. It lies at the very mouth of the lagoon
opening out from the Grand Canal. It arrests the
eyes of all who go to and fro the Lido. It was, a
little while ago, a little paradise of solitude, fragrance
and beauty. Its thickets of wild rose, of jessamine,
and of myrtle, were filled with song-birds. Its old
church, the oldest in the Veneto, stood, grey and
venerable, amidst the shade of green acacias and
flowering oleanders. The little world of blossom
and of melody, hung between the sea and sky, had a
holiness, a pathos, a perfection of woodland loveliness
not to be told in words; there no sound was heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>except the bells of the matins and vespers, the lapping
of the waves, the whir of the white gulls’ wings, and
the echo of some gondolier’s boating song. To sit
in its quiet cloisters, with the fragrance of its wild
gardens all around, and see the sun set beyond
Venice, and the deep rose of evening spread over the
arch of the skies and the silver plain of the waters,
was to live a little while in the same world that
Giorgione and Veronese knew. It seems like a vision
of a nightmare to find these cloisters levelled and
these gardens and trees destroyed; the whole island
made a grimy, smoking mound of clay and ruins.
Yet thus it is. The government has chosen to make
it a site for a factory and foundry; and, not content
with this defilement, is throwing up, upon it and
beside it, acres of the stinking sand and clay dredged
up from the canals, intending in due time to cover
this new soil with other factories and foundries, full
in the face of the Ducal Palace, a few furlongs from
the Piazza of St Mark. Viler devastation was never
more iniquitously or more unpardonably wrought.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meantime the very commonest care is refused to such
interesting and priceless houses as the House of the
Camel, which is let out to a number of poor and dirty
tenants, with its eponymus alto-relievo made the target
for the stones of the children; while in the same
quarter of the Madonna dell’ Orta, close at hand, a
manufacturer is allowed to send the mouths of his
steam-tubes hissing through the iron arabesques and
between the carved foliage of a most noble Gothic
doorway belonging to a deserted church.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am aware that it is useless to protest against these
things. The soul in the country is withered up by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>small greeds. All these irreparable injuries are done
that municipal councillors may pocket some gain, and
any stranger who has the money necessary can purchase
from the Conscript Fathers of the hour the right
to defile, to annex, to violate, to destroy the fairest
and most sacred places in Italy. The goddess is
given over to the ravishing of any boor who brings a
money-bag.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scholar, the poet, the archæologist are all
abhorred in modern Italy; their protests are impatiently
derided, their reverence is contemptuously
ridiculed, their love of art, of nature, or of history, is
regarded as a folly, ill-timed and inconvenient, lunatic
and hysterical. But the new-comer who proposes a
machine, a chimney, a monster hotel, a bubble company,
or a tramway station, is welcomed with open
arms; it is considered that he means ‘progress,’ <i>i.e.</i>,
that he means a subsidy for some one, a general
scramble for gold pieces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Emile de Lavaleye has demonstrated, in his recent
<i>Lettres d’ Italie</i>, that these works in Venice, so fatal
to the city, cannot ever result in any financial profit;
that, with coal forty francs a ton, it is impossible they
should ever bring any; that all industry of the kind
is artificial and pernicious in Italy, and ends in impoverishing
the many to enrich a few.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a wanton love of destruction which can alone
lead a people who possess neither iron nor coal to make
foundries and factories in Venice, the most lovely and
luminous city of the sea. These works cannot be
ever profitable at Venice, by reason of the immense
cost of the transport there of the metals and combustibles
necessary for their development. Yet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>every direction their foul smoke is rising, and dimming
that translucent air so dear to every painter
from Carpaccio to Aïvarnovski. From the Zattere
alone no less than fourteen factory chimneys are
visible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Fondamenté Nuové was in the days of the
Doges the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>riva</i></span>, consecrated to the villas and
pleasure-gardens of the Venetian nobles; their palaces
were only for winter habitation or ceremonious use,
but the beautiful garden-houses facing Murano were
their retreat for mirth, ease and recreation of all
kinds, with nothing between them and the silvery
lagoon except the clouds of foliage and of blossom
which then covered these little isles. Nothing would
have been easier than to make this shore now what
it was then, and it would even have been undoubtedly
profitable to have done so. Will it be credited that,
instead, it has been selected as the especial site of gas-works
and iron-works and all abominations of stench
and smoke, whilst, instead of the laughing loveliness of
flowering lawns leaning to touch the sea, there is a
long and dreary brick embankment, on which you
can walk if you choose, and recall, if you can, the
‘tender grace of a day that is dead’?</p>

<p class='c001'>‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>La lumière de Venise</i></span>‘ has been the theme of all
poets and the enchantment of all travellers for
centuries; that opal-hued, translucent, ethereal light
has been the wonder of every wanderer who has
found himself in the enchantment of its silvery
radiance. ’<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>On nage dans la lumière</i></span>,’ is the just
expression of Taine, to describe the exquisite effulgence
of the light in Venice. Yet this wonder, this
delight, this gift of Nature from sea and sky, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>modern masters of the fate of Venice deliberately
sacrifice, that a few greedy commercial adventurers
may set up their chimneys on the shores consecrated
to St Mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Venetian populace have still in themselves
a sense of colour and a passion for verdure; in every
little <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>calle</i></span> and at every <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>traghetto</i></span> an acacia grows and
a vine climbs; on the sails of the fishing and fruit
boats there are painted figures, and in the garb of
those who steer them there is still picturesque choice
of form and hue. But in the Venetian municipality,
as in every other Italian municipality, all taste is
dead, all shame is dead with it; and the only existence,
the only passion, left in their stead, are those
of gain and of destruction. On the Giudecca hideous
factories, which belch out the blackest of smoke close
to the dome of the Church of the Redentore, have
been allowed to pollute the atmosphere and disgrace
the view; and in every shed or outhouse where anyone
has a fancy to stick up the iron tube of an engine,
similar smoke passes forth, making day frightful and
clouding the lagoon for miles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Reverence, and that sense of fitness which always
goes with reverence, are wholly lacking in the modern
Italian mind. There is a kind of babyish self-admiration
in its stead, which is the most sterile of all moral
ground, and with which it is impossible to argue,
because it is deaf and blind, inwrapped in its own
vanity. In a few years’ time, if the Italian kingdom
last, it will insist on its history being re-written, and
the debts that it owed to the French Emperor in ’59
and to the German Emperor in ’70 being struck out
of its balance-sheet altogether. Nothing was more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>untrue, more bombastical, or more misleading than
the favourite phrase, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Italia fara da se</i></span>; but it is one
of those untruths which have been caressed and
repeated until they are accepted as facts; and the
injury done by this conceit to the present generation
is very great.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nature has done all for Italy; it is a soil which
is indeed blessed of the gods; from its pure and
radiant air to its wildflowers, which spring as though
Aphrodite were still here ‘to sow them with her
odorous foot,’ it is by Nature perfectly dowered and
thrice blessed. In its roseate dawns, its crystal,
clear moonlight, its golden afternoons, it has still
the lovely light of an unworn world. Art joined
hands with Nature, and gave her best and her
richest treasures to Italy. It is, to any scholar,
artist, poet, or reverent pilgrim to her shrines, a
thing of intolerable odium, of unutterable sorrow,
that the very people born of her soil should be
thus ignorant of her exquisite beauty, thus mercenary,
venal and unshamed in their prostitution
of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even amongst those who follow art as their
calling, there is no sense of colour or of fitness.
When the old houses of the Via degli Archibusieri
were pulled down in Florence, to lay bare the
colonnade beneath them, a committee of artists
deliberated for three months as to the best method
of dealing with this colonnade. The result of their
deliberations was to cover the old stone with stucco
and paint the stones brown, with white borders!
The effect is enhanced by upright lamp-posts, coloured
brown, stuck in the middle of the way. The excuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>given for the demolition of the houses was that the
removal of them would widen a thoroughfare: as
the lamp-posts are much more obstructive to drivers
than the houses were, the correctness of the reasons
given can be easily gauged. This is an example
of all the rest. ‘Are we to go in rags for sake of
being picturesque?’ said a syndic now ruling one
of the chief cities of Italy, to a person who complained
to him of the destruction of art and beauty
now common throughout the peninsula. The reply
is characteristic of that illogical stupidity and that
absolute colour-blindness which are common to the
modern Italian, or, let us say, the municipal Italian
mind. They are insensible themselves to the horror
of their work, just as they are unconscious why
yellow, blue and green chairs on a red carpet offend
a delicate taste. To whitewash frescoed walls; to
make old monasteries look brand new; to scrub and
peel and skin sculptured marbles; to daub over
beautiful arches and columns and cloisters with
tempera paintings, mechanically reproduced in one
set pattern over and over again, over miles of stucco;
to outrage the past and vulgarise the present; to
respect nothing; to set the glaring seal of a despotic
and bourgeois administration over all which ages
have made lovely and reverent—all this they think
an admirable and hygienic work, while they let
human excrement be strewn broadcast over the fields
and emptied in the street at midday under broiling
heat, and set the guards of their rivers to drive out
with blows of the scabbard the poor children who
would fain splash and bathe in them under canicular
suns. The excuse of hygiene is only the parrot cry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>which covers the passion for iconoclasm and destruction.
To make their own <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>interessi</i></span> while the moment
lasts is the only desire at the heart of all these civic
councillors and engineers, architects and contractors,
house-owners and speculators. To petty personal
purposes and selfish personal profits everything is
sacrificed by the innumerable prefects, syndics, and
town councillors, by whom Italy is regarded as the
Turkish pashas regarded the Egyptian fellah.</p>

<p class='c001'>Florence, again, might, with great ease, have been
made one of the most beautiful cities of Europe: if
there had been only moderate care and decent taste displayed
in its administration, its natural and architectural
charms were so great that it would have been a
facile task to keep them unharmed. If its suburbs, indeed,
of ugliness and squalor, could show good roads
and shady avenues; if its river banks, instead of brick
walls, showed grass and trees; if its filthy cab-stands
were kept out of sight, and its city trees allowed to
grow at the will of Nature, Florence would be lovely
and twice as healthy as it is. But there is no attempt
to preserve what is beautiful, or to make what is of
necessity modern accord in any manner with the old;
whilst on trees there is waged a war which can only
oblige one to conclude that those who are entrusted
with the care of them have no eye except to the
filling of their own wood-cellars. It is a very common
thing to see an avenue of plane or lime trees with
their heads cut off, whilst all the trees, whether in the
public gardens or on the boulevards, are chopped and
hacked out of all likeness to themselves, and of course
dry up and perish long before their time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing can be more criminal that what is actually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>now being proposed in the Florence town council, i.e.,
to raise a loan of eight millions, at four per cent., to
destroy the entire old centre of the city.<a id='rB' /><a href='#fB' class='c015'><sup>[B]</sup></a> I repeat,
nothing more criminal, more wasteful, or more senseless
could be done. Florence is very poor; a few years
ago she was on the brink of bankruptcy; taxation is
enormous throughout Tuscany; the poorest are taxed
for the very bed they lie on; the amount which she
has to pay to the government from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>dazio consume</i></span>
(that is, the octroi duty at the gates, on all food and
produce of every kind entering the town) is extravagant
and intolerable. So cruelly are the simplest
productions of the soil mulcted by taxation that every
class suffers, whether producer or consumer. The
annual interest payable on the new loan will add
immensely to the burdens which the city bears; and
for what purpose is such a loan to be contracted?
For the purpose of pulling down the oldest and most
historic parts of Florence, to create a naked wilderness
which will be changed into one of those squares, dusty
and hideous, with metal lamp-posts round it and
stunted shrubs in the centre of it, which represent to
the municipal Italian the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne plus ultra</i></span> of loveliness
and civilisation. The excuse given of hygienic reasons
is a lie. All the uncleanly classes which dwelt in the
Ghetto have been bundled off wholesale to the S.
Frediano quarters, where they will continue to dwell
with unchanged habits, a few score of yards removed
from where they were before. The dirt of Italian
cities is not due to the age or shape of the streets, it
is due to the filthy personal habits of the people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>which are the same in a wide and roomy farm-house
in the pine woods as in a garret of a town. They
love dirt; water never touches their bodies all the year
round, and never touches even their faces or hands in
winter; they like their vegetables raw, their wine
sour; their pipes are eternally in their mouths, and
their clothes reek with every stench under heaven. It
is the habits of the people, not the formation of the
streets, which constitute the standing peril of pestilence
in Italy. They would make a new house as
filthy as an old one in a week. For what, then, is this
enormous, useless, and unpardonable addition to the
civil debt of Florence incurred? Only to put money
in the pockets of a few speculators, and a few owners
of the soil, at the cost of destroying all that is most
interesting, valuable, and historical in the city.</p>

<p class='c001'>Will it be credited by any readers of these words
that it is actually in contemplation to turn the old
piazza behind the Palazzo Strozzi into a range of
glass-galleries like those of Milan or of Brussels? It
is incredible that a whole civil population can tranquilly
permit such outrage, and such grotesque outrage, to
be committed in its name.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is indeed very much as though the owner of
Raffaeles and Titians tore them up into tatters and
bought chromo-lithographs and olegraphs to hang in
their places.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oftentimes the populace itself is pained and mortified
to see its old heirlooms torn down and its old
associations destroyed, but the populace has no power;
the whole civic power is vested in the bureaucracy,
and civic electoral rights are wholly misunderstood
and practically unused by the masses of the people.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>It is for the most part the smug and self-complacent
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bourgeoisie</i></span> which rules, and which finds a curious
delight in the contemplation of everything which can
destroy the cities of the Renaissance, and the records
of classic Latium, to replace them with some gimcrack
and brand-new imitation of a third-rate modern
French or Belgian town, glaring with plate-glass,
gilding, dust, smoke, acres of stucco, and oceans
of asphalt.</p>

<p class='c001'>The modern Italian has not the faintest conception
of the kind of religious reverence with which the
English, the German, the American scholar visits the
cities of Italy. Such an emotion seems to the son of
the soil wholly inexplicable and grotesquely sentimental.
If the Englishman praise a monster hotel or
a torpedo-boat, or the German the march of a regiment,
or the American the shafts of a factory, then,
and then only, will the Italian regard the travellers
with complacency. And what is done in the cities is
repeated in the small towns, of which the municipalities
think it grand and ‘advanced’ to imitate the
innovations of larger ones, and where the house-owners
and owners of the soil are just as greedy as their
town councillors, and just as eager to sacrifice any
classic beauty or mediæval memory for gain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could Dante come to life, no curse that he ever
breathed upon his countrymen would be one-half so
fierce and deep as that with which he would devote
the Italian of the close of the nineteenth century to
the vengeance of the offended gods. But Dante’s self
would say his curses to deaf ears, wadded close with
the wool of vanity and greed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile the taxation of all these towns is so high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>that tradespeople are ruined in them, as the country
proprietors are ruined in hundreds and thousands by
the imposts on land and all that land produces.
Against blind cupidity the gods themselves are impotent.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>THE<br />FAILURE OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>Very soon, as the history of the world counts
time, Christianity will have completed its two
thousand years of existence. In some shape or other
its doctrines dominate the civilised portions of
Europe and America and Australasia; and even
in Asia and in Africa its representatives and
its missionaries are busied in the endeavours to
diffuse them into the dark places of the earth.
Whether we accept it as what is called a revealed
or supernatural religion, or whether we more rationally
consider it an offspring of the older and similar
myths of Asia united to Judaism, the fact remains the
same of the immense area of its adoption by the human
race, and especially by the Aryan race. Islamism is
widespread, but has no continuous power of proselytism
similar to Christianity; and Judaism, though inexorably
potent on the Jewish tribes, whatever
country they inhabit, can claim little or no power of
attracting strangers within its fold; does not, indeed,
seek to attract any.</p>

<p class='c001'>To live and spread as it has done, Christianity must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>have some vital force within itself superior to those
possessed by other creeds. It must be suited to the
human race in some manner which the religion of
Mohammed and that of Israel have alike missed.
Indeed, the whole history of the acquisition of its
dominion is very singular, and has probably been due
to the socialistic element contained in it; for the
gospels are a breviary intimately dear to the heart of
every communist. Mohammedanism is aristocratic; so
is Judaism, so were the Greek and Latin religions; but
Christianity is the religion of democracy, of universal
equality, of the poor man consoled for privation on
earth by his belief that such privation is surely the
narrow gate by which heaven alone can be reached.
Even in the moment when Christianity most nearly
approached an aristocratic worship, it still contained
the germs of democracy; it still held out hope to the
poor man, hope both spiritual and material; in the
feudal ages, when it was the war-cry of knights and
ruling power of great kings and arrogant priests, it
still whispered in the ear of the swineherd and the
scullion,—‘Take my tonsure and my habit, and who
knows that thou mayest not live to earn the triple
crown?’</p>

<p class='c001'>Because Socialism is for a great part atheistic, it has
been wholly forgotten how socialistic have been the
influences on society of Christianity. The evangels
are essentially the dream of a poor man; the vision
of a peasant asleep after a day of toil, and seeing in
his vision the angels come for him, whilst they spurn
the rich man on whose fields he has laboured. ‘Come
to Me, all ye who sorrow and are heavy-laden, and I
will give you rest.’ It is the invitation to the poor;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>not to the rich. The disciples are fishermen for the
most part; Christ is himself a carpenter; the whole
dream is a passion-play of peasants as entirely as that
which represented it last year in Ammergau; and
in it power, intellect and law are all subverted and
proved wrong when Pilate gets down from the judgment-seat,
and the watching fishers believe that they
behold the resurrection. This socialistic influence the
doctrines of Christianity have had, and have gradually
made felt throughout many ages, and are making felt
more sharply and rudely in this our own than in any
other age. The most ‘pious’ of all sects are also
always the most democratic; the Nonconformists and
the Wesleyans are always the most intent on levelling
the barriers and irregularities of social life. Protestantism
was the democratic daughter of the Papacy, but
the Papacy was also a democrat when it made it possible
for a swineherd to hold the keys of St Peter,
and for a Becket to rule a Plantagenet, for a Wolsey
to rule a Tudor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again and again the humble vassal lived to thunder
excommunication upon monarchs, and the timid scribe
who dared not lift his eyes from his scroll became the
most powerful, the most arrogant, the most inexorable
of churchmen. It was this hope contained within it
for the lowliest, this palm held out by it to the poorest,
which made the enormous influence of Christianity
from the days of Basil and Augustine to the days of
Richelieu and Wolsey. The feudal lords who shouted
Christian war-cries, and the despotic kings who swore
by the Holy Rood and by Our Lady, were wholly
unconscious that in the creed they cherished there
were the germs of the democratic influences which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>would in time to come undermine thrones and make
aristocracy an empty name; they did not know that
in Clement Marot’s psalm-books and in Wycliffe’s
Bible there lay folded that which would in time to
come bring forth the thesis of Bakounine and the
demands of the Knights of Labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we meditate on and realise the essentially
socialistic tendencies of the Christian creed, we may
wonder that the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>grands de la terre</i></span>’ ever so
welcomed it, or ever failed to see in it the death-germs
of their own order; but we shall completely
understand why it fascinated all the labouring classes
of mankind and planted in them those seeds of communism
which are now bearing forth full fruit. But
what is almost equally certain is that Christianity will
be wholly powerless to restrain the results of what it
has inspired.</p>

<p class='c001'>For of all absolutely powerless things on earth
Christianity is the most powerless, even though
sovereigns are still consecrated, multitudes still baptised,
parliaments and tribunals still opened, and
countless churches and cathedrals still built in its
name. It has become a shibboleth, a husk, a robe
with no heart beating within it, a winged angel carved
in dead wood. It has said that it is almost impossible
for the rich man to be just or inherit the
kingdom of heaven: the Anarchists insist that it is
utterly impossible, and will, if they can, cast the rich
man into hell on earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Christianity has opened the flood-gates to Socialism;
but it will not have any power in itself to close them
again. For nothing can be in more complete contradiction
than the prevalence of the profession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Christianity with the impotency of that profession to
colour and control human life. The Buddha of
Galilee has not one-thousandth part of the direct
influence on his professional disciples that is possessed
by the Buddha of India. Christianity is
professed over the whole earth wherever the Aryan
race exists and rules, but all the kingdoms and
republics which make it their state creed are, practically,
wholly unaffected by its doctrines, except in so
far as their socialistic members derive precedent and
strength from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take, for instance, that which governs states and
prescribes the duties of men—the majesty of the law,
as it is termed—the science and the practice of legislation.
Side by side with the religion enjoined by
the state there exists a code of legislation which
violates every precept of Christianity, and resembles
only the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex talionis</i></span> of the old Hebrew law, which
the Christian creed was supposed to have destroyed
and superseded.</p>

<p class='c001'>A savage insistence on having an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth is the foundation of all
modern law. The European, or the American, or the
Australasian, goes on Sunday to his church and says
his formula, ‘Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us,’ and then on the
Monday morning prosecutes a boy who stole a ball
of string, or a neighbour who has invaded a right of
way, or an enemy whose cow has strayed, or whose
horse has kicked, or whose dog has bitten, and exacts
for one and all of these offences the uttermost penalty
that the law will permit him to demand. It may be
said that such law is absolutely necessary in civilised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>states: it may be so: but then the empty formula of
the Christian forgiveness of trespasses should be in
honesty abandoned.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Ruskin never writes on Venice without dwelling
on the vital influence of the Christian creed on
the men of the middle ages, and contrasting the religious
spirit of those whose cry was St Mark, and
whose admiration was St Jerome, with those of
modern times, when these names mean nothing on
the ears of men. But, in truth, the influence was
architectural and artistic rather than moral; the
memory neither of St Mark nor St Jerome ever prevented
the blinding of the eyes of doges who had
displeased the people, the treachery and brutality of
their inexorable decrees, the torture of the Foscari,
the betrayal of Carracciolo, the sale of slaves, or
any one of the awful cruelties and tyrannies of the
Council of Ten.</p>

<p class='c001'>As it was in the Venice of the middle ages, so
has it been and is wherever Christianity is nominally
dominant. The cross is embroidered on banners and
its psalter is carried to churches in pious hands, but
its real influence on the life of nations is as slight as
that of Mark and Jerome on the Council of Ten.
The whole practical life of nations lives, breathes and
holds its place by creeds and necessities which are
the complete antithesis of the Christian; they are
selfish in their policies, bloodthirsty in their wars,
cunning in their diplomacy, avaricious in their commerce,
unsparing in their hours of victory. They
are so, and, alas! they must be so, or they would be
pushed out of their place amongst nations, and
parcelled out, like Joseph’s coat, amongst their foes.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The capitalist who makes millions by the manufacture
of rifled cannon sees no inconsistency in murmuring
in his seat at Catholic mass or Protestant service,
‘Return good for evil,’ ‘If one cheek be smitten, turn
the other,’ and all the rest of the evangelical injunctions
to peace and forbearance: were any to suggest
to him the inconsistency of his conduct, such an one
would speak to deaf ears; that his whole life was a
violation of the precepts he professed would be an
unintelligible reproach to him: his soul would take
refuge, smug and safe, in his formulas. Yet who can
deny that, if the commands of Christianity had in the
least penetrated beneath the surface of human life, to
make weapons of destruction would be viewed as a
crime so frightful that none would dare attempt it?
Some writer has said that ‘singing psalms never yet
prevented a grocer from sanding his sugar.’ This
rough joke expresses in a grotesque form what may
be said in all seriousness of the impotency of Christianity
to affect modern national life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Christianity is a formula: it is nothing more. The
nations in which daily services in its honour are said
in thousands and tens of thousands of cathedrals and
churches, sell opium to the Chinese, cheat and slay
red Indians, slaughter with every brutality the peaceful
natives of Tonquin and Anam, carry fire and
sword into central Asia, kill Africans like ants on
expeditions, and keep a whole populace in the grip of
military service from the Spree to the Elbe, from the
Zuider Zee to the Tiber, from the Seine to the Neva.
Whether the nation be England, America, France,
Russia, Italy, or Germany, the fact is the same; with
the gospels on its reading-desks and their shibboleth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>on its lips, every nation practically follows the lusts
and passions of its human greeds for possession of
territory and increase of treasure. Not one amongst
them is better in this matter than another. Krupp
guns, shrapnel shells, nitro-glycerine and submarine
torpedoes are the practical issues of evangelicism and
Catholicism all over the civilised world. And the
nations are so sublimely unconscious of their own
hypocrisy that they have blessings on their warfare
pronounced by their ecclesiastics, and implore the
Lord of Hosts for his sympathy before sending out
armoured cruisers.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is inevitable, is the reply: in the present state
of hostility between all nations, the first one to renounce
the arts of war would be swallowed up by
the others. So it would be, no doubt; but if this be
the chief fruit of Christianity, may not this religion
justly be said to have failed conspicuously in impressing
itself upon mankind? It has impressed its
formulas; not its spirit. It has sewn a phylactery
on the hem of humanity’s robe: it has never touched
the soul of humanity beneath the robe. It has produced
the iniquities of the Inquisition, the egotism
and celibacy of the monasteries, the fury of religious
wars, the ferocity of the Hussite, of the Catholic, of
the Puritan, of the Spaniard, of the Irish Orangeman
and of the Irish Papist; it has divided families,
alienated friends, lighted the torch of civil war, and
borne the virgin and the greybeard to the burning
pile, broken delicate limbs upon the wheel and wrung
the souls and bodies of innocent creatures on the
rack: all this it has done, and done in the name of
God.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>But of mercy, of pity, of forbearance, of true self-sacrifice,
what has it ever taught the world?</p>

<p class='c001'>A while ago there was published an account of the
manufacture of the deadliest sort of dynamite on the
shores of Arran. Full in the front of the great sea,
with all the majesty of a rock-bound and solitary
shore around them, these hideous works raise their
blaspheming face to Nature and pollute and profane
her most solemn glories; and there, on this coast
of Arran, numbers of young girls work at the devilish
thing in wooden huts, with every moment the ever-present
risk of women and huts being blown into
millions of atoms if so much as a shred of metal, or
even a ray of too warm sunshine, strike on the foul,
sickly, infernal compound which their fingers handle.
A brief while since two girls were thus blown into
the air, and were so instantaneously and utterly annihilated
that not a particle of their bodies or of their
clothing could be recognised; and all the while the
sea-gulls were circling, and the waves leaping, and
the clouds sailing, and deep calling to deep, ‘Lo!
behold the devil and all his works.’ And there is no
devil there at all except man—man who makes
money out of this fell thing which blasts the beauties
of Nature, and scars the faces of the hills, and has
made possible to civilisation a fashion of wholesale
assassination so horrible, so craven, and so treacherous
that the boldness of open murder seems almost
virtue beside it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The manufactory of nitro-glycerine on the Arran
shore is the emblem of the world which calls itself
Christian. No doubt the canny Scots who are
enriched by it go to their kirk religiously, are elders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of it, very likely, and if they saw a boy trundle a hoop,
or a girl use a needle on the Sabbath day, would
think they saw a crime, and would summon and
chastise the sinners. Pontius Pilate was afraid and
ashamed when he had condemned an innocent man;
but the modern followers of Christ have neither fear
nor shame when they pile up gold on gold in their
bankers’ cellars through the death which they have
manufactured and sold, indifferent though it should
strike down a thousand innocent men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even of death Christianity has made a terror which
was unknown to the gay calmness of the Pagan and
the stoical repose of the Indian. Never has death
been the cause of such craven timidity as in the
Christian world, to which, if Christians believed any
part of what they profess, it would be the harbinger of
glad tidings, the welcome messenger of a more perfect
life. To visionaries like Catherine of Siena, it may
have been so at times, but to the masses of men and
women professing the Christian faith, death has been
and is the King of Terrors, from whose approach
they cower in an agony which Petronius Arbiter would
have ridiculed, and Socrates and Seneca have scorned.
The Greek and the Latin gave dignity to death, and
awaited it with philosophy and peace; but the Christian
beholds in it innumerable fears like a child’s
terror of ghosts in darkness, and by the manner of the
funeral rites with which he celebrates it contrives to
make grotesque even that mute majesty which rests
with the dead slave as much as with the dead emperor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Christianity has been cruel in much to the human
race. It has quenched much of the sweet joy and
gladness of life; it has caused the natural passions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and affections of it to be held as sins; by its teaching
that the body should be despised, it has brought on
all the unnamable filth which was made a virtue in
the monastic orders, and which in the Italian, the
Spanish, the Russian peoples, and the poor of all
nations is a cherished and indestructible habit. In
its permission to man to render subject to him all
other living creatures of the earth, it continued the
cruelty of the barbarian and of the pagan, and endowed
these with what appeared a divine authority—an
authority which Science, despising Christianity,
has yet not been ashamed to borrow and to use.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us, also, endeavour to realise the unutterable torments
endured by men and maidens in their efforts to
subdue the natural desires of their senses and their
affections to the unnatural celibacy of the cloister, and
we shall see that the tortures inflicted by Christianity
have been more cruel than the cruelties of death.
Christianity has ever been the enemy of human love;
it has forever cursed and expelled and crucified the
one passion which sweetens and smiles on human life,
which makes the desert blossom as the rose, and which
glorifies the common things and common ways of
earth. It made of this, the angel of life, a shape of
sin and darkness, and bade the woman whose lips
were warm with the first kisses of her lover believe
herself accursed and ashamed. Even in the unions
which it reluctantly permitted, it degraded and
dwarfed the passion which it could not entirely exclude,
and permitted it coarsely to exist for the mere
necessity of procreation. The words of the Christian
nuptial service expressly say so. Love, the winged
god of the immortals, became, in the Christian creed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>a thrice-damned and earth-bound devil, to be exorcised
and loathed. This has been the greatest injury
that Christianity has ever done to the human race.
Love, the one supreme, unceasing source of human
felicity, the one sole joy which lifts the whole mortal
existence into the empyrean, was by it degraded into
the mere mechanical action of reproduction. It cut
the wings of Eros. Man, believing that he must no
longer love his mistress, woman, believing that she
must no longer love her lover, loved themselves, and
from the cloisters and from the churches there arose
a bitter, joyless, narrow, apprehensive passion which
believed itself to be religion, but was in truth only a
form of concentrated egotism, the agonised desire to
be ‘saved,’ to ascend into the highest heaven, let who
else would wait without its doors or pine in hell.
The influence of this is still with the world, and will
long be with it; and its echo is still loud in the sibilant
voices which hiss at the poet who sings and the poet
who glorifies love.</p>

<p class='c001'>And herein we approach that spurious offspring of
Christianity which is called cant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other religions have not been without it. The
Mosaic law had the Pharisee, who for a pretence made
long prayers. The Greek and the Latin had those
who made oblations to the gods for mere show, and
augurs who served the sacred altars with their tongue
in their cheek. But from Christianity, alas! has
arisen and spread a systematic hypocrisy more general,
more complete, more vain, more victorious than any
other. The forms of the Christian religion facilitate
this. Whether in the Catholic form of it, which
cleanses the sinner in the confessional that he may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>go forth and sin again freely, or in the Protestant
form, which, so long as a man listens to sermons and
kneels at sacraments, does not disturb him as to the
tenor of his private life, the Christian religion says,
practically, to all its professors: ‘Wear my livery
and assemble in my courts; I ask no more of you
in return for the moral reputation which I will give
to you.’</p>

<p class='c001'>Its lip-service and its empty rites have made it the
easiest of all tasks for the usurer to cloak his
cruelties, the miser to hide his avarice, the lawyer
to condone his lies, the sinner of all social sins to
purchase the social immunity from them by outward
deference to churches.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Christian religion, outwardly and even in
intention humble, does, without meaning it, teach
man to regard himself as the most important of all
created things. Man surveys the starry heavens and
hears with his ears of the plurality of worlds; yet his
religion bids him believe that his alone out of these
innumerable spheres is the object of his master’s love
and sacrifice. To save his world—whose common
multitudes can be no more in the scale of creation
than the billions of insects that build up a coral-reef
beneath the deep sea—he is told that God himself
took human shape, underwent human birth, was fed
with human food, and suffered human pains. It is
intelligible that, believing this, the most arrogant self-conceit
has puffed up the human crowd, and that with
the most cruel indifference they have sacrificed to
themselves all the countless suffering multitudes which
they are taught to call ‘the beasts which perish.’ It
is this selfishness and self-esteem which, fostered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the human race by Christianity, have far outweighed
and overborne the humility which its doctrines in
part strove to inculcate and the mercy which they
advocated.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in vain that the human race is bidden to
believe that its Creator cares for the lilies of the field
and for the birds of the air: it is the human race
alone for which its God has suffered and died, so it
believes, and this solitary selection, this immense
supremacy, make it semi-divine in its own sight. It
is the leaven of egotism begotten by the Christian
creed which has neutralised the purity and the influence
of its teachings. Here and there saintly men
and women have been guided by it solely in the
ways of holiness and unselfishness; but the great
majority of mankind has drawn from it chiefly two
lessons—self-concentration and socialism. ‘Rock of
ages, cleft for <em>me</em>,’ sighs the Christian; and this ‘immense
Me’ is, as Emerson has said of it, the centre of
the universe in the belief of the unconscious egotist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Christians repeat like a parrot’s recitative the phrase
that no sparrow falls uncounted by its Creator, and
they go to their crops and scatter poison, or load
fowling-pieces with small shot to destroy hundreds of
sparrows in a morning. If they believed that their
God saw the little birds of the air fall, would they
dare to do it? Of course they would not; but they
do not believe: it only suits them to use their formula,
and they are never prevented by it from strewing
bird-poison or setting bird-traps.</p>

<p class='c001'>Behold their priests taking on themselves the vows
of poverty, of chastity, and of renunciation, and
whether they be the Catholic cardinal, stately, luxurious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and arrogant, or whether they be the Protestant
bishop, with his liveried servants, his dinner parties,
and his church patronage, what can we see more
widely removed in unlikeness from all the precepts of
the creed which they profess to obey? What fiercer
polemics ever rage than those which wrangle about
the body of religion? What judge would not be
thought a madman who should from the bench
counsel the man who has received a blow to bear it
in meekness and turn the other cheek? What
missionary would be excused for leaving his wife and
children chargeable on parish rates because he pointed
to the injunction to leave all that he had and follow
Christ?</p>

<p class='c001'>What attempt on the part of any community to put
the precepts of Christianity into practical observance
would not cause them to be denounced to magistrates
as communists, as anarchists, as moonstruck dreamers,
as lunatics? There are sects in Russia which
endeavour to do so, and the police hunt them down
like wild animals. They are only logically trying to
carry out the precepts of the gospels, but they are
regarded therefore as dangerous lunatics. They can
have no place in the conventional civilisation of the
world. What judge who should tell the two litigants
in any lawsuit concerning property that they were
violating every religious duty in wrangling with each
other about filthy lucre would not be deemed a fool, and
worse? The French Republic, in tearing down from
its courts of law and from its class-rooms the emblems
of Christianity, has done a rough, but sincere and consistent,
act, if one offensive to a great portion of the
nation; and it may be alleged that this act is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>logical than the acts of those nations who open their
tribunals with rites of reverence towards a creed with
which the whole legislature governing these tribunals
is in entire and militant contradiction. ‘Religion is
one thing; law is another,’ said a lawyer once to
whom this strange discrepancy was commented on;
but so long as law is founded on assumptions and
principles wholly in violence with those of religion,
how can such religion be called the religion of the
state? It is as absurd a discrepancy as that with
which the Italian nation, calling itself Catholic, drove
out thousands of Catholic monks and Catholic nuns
from their religious houses and seized their possessions
by the force of the secular arm. It is not here the
question whether the suppression of the male and
female monastic orders was or was not right or necessary;
what is certain is that the state, enforcing this
suppression, can with no shadow of sense or of logic
continue to call itself a Catholic state; as it still does
continue to call itself in the person of its king and
in its public decrees.</p>

<p class='c001'>How is it to be accounted for—this impotence of
Christianity to affect the policies, politics, legislation
and general life of the nations which think their salvation
lies in the profession of its creed? How is it
that a religion avowedly making peace and long-suffering
of injury the corner-stone of its temple has
had as its principal outcome war, both the fanaticism
of religious war and the avarice of civil war; a legislation
founded on the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex talionis</i></span> and inexorable in its
adherence to that law; and a commerce which all the
world over is saturated with the base desire to overreach,
outwit and outstrip all competitors?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>It is chiefly due to the absolutely ‘unworkable’
character of its injunctions; and partly due to the
Jewish laws entering so largely into the creeds of
modern Christians: also it is due to the fact that even
in the purer creeds of the evangelists there is so
much of egotism. ‘What shall it profit a man if he
gain the whole world and lose his own soul?’ ‘His
own’—that throughout is to be the chief thought
of his existence and its constant end. The greatest
of the Christian martyrs were but egotists when
they were not matoïdes. Their fortitude and constancy
were already rewarded, in their belief, by
every sweetness of celestial joys and glories. It may
be doubted whether they even felt the scourge, the
torch, the iron, or the rods, so intensely in their
exaltation was their nervous system strung up to
ecstasy. What could the poor offer of earthly life
seem worth to those who believed that by thus losing
it they would enter at once and forever into the
exquisite consciousness of a surpassing beatitude?
An intense, though innocent, selfishness was at the
root of all the martyrdoms of the early Christian
Church. There was not one amongst them which
approached for unselfishness the death of Antinous.
And it is surely this egotism which is an integral part
of the Christian creed, and which has been at once
its strength and its weakness; its strength in giving
it dominion over human nature, and its weakness
in allying it with baser things. The alloy has
made the gold more workable, but has destroyed its
purity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, although the majority of Christian
nations profess the Christian faith more or less sincerely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and give it at least the homage of hypocrisy,
all the intellectual life of the world is leaving its folds
without concealment. There is in its stead either the
hard and soulless materialism of the scientist, or the
sad, vague pantheism and pessimism of the scholar
and the poet. Neither will ever suffice for the mass
of mankind in general. The purely imaginative and
intellectual mind can be content to wait before the
immense unexplained enigma of life; it accepts its
mystery, and sees the marvel of it, in the changing
cloud, the blossoming weed, the wistful eyes of the
beasts of burden, as much as it sees it in humanity
itself. To such a mind the calmness and sadness of
patience, and the kind of universal divinity which it
finds in nature, can suffice: and to it the complacent
conceit of science over the discovery of a new poison,
or a hitherto unsuspected action of the biliary duct in
mammals, must seem as childish and as narrow as does
the belief in the creeds of the Papist, the Evangelical, or
the Baptist. This is the only mental attitude which is
at once philosophic and spiritual; but it must ever
remain the privilege of the few; it can never be the
possession of the multitude. The multitude will be
forever cast into the arms of science, or of faith, either
of which will alike flatter it with the assurance that
it is the chief glory of creation, before which all
the rest of creation is bound to lie subject in bonds
and pain.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is this selfishness and self-admiration which have
neutralised in man the good which he should have
gained from the simple benevolence of the Sermon on
the Mount. A religion which is founded on the desire
of men to attain eternal felicity will be naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>seductive to them, but the keynote of its motive power
can never be a lofty one. The jewelled streets of the
New Jerusalem are not more luxuriously dreamed of
than the houris of the Mohammedan paradise. Each
form of celestial recompense is anticipated as reward
for devotion to a creed. And as all loyalty, all loveliness,
all virtue <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pêchent par la base</i></span> when they are
founded on the expectation of personal gain, so the
Christian religion has contained the radical defect of
inciting its followers to obedience and faithfulness by
a bribe—a grand bribe truly—nothing less than eternal
life; such life as the soul of man cannot even conceive;
but still a bribe. Therefore Christianity has
been powerless to enforce its own ethics on the world
in the essence of their spirit, and has been perforce
contented with hearing it recite its formulas.</p>

<p class='c001'>What will be its future? There is no prophet of
vision keen enough to behold. The intellect of mankind
is every year forsaking it more utterly, and the
ever-increasing luxury which is possible with riches,
and the ever-increasing materialism of all kinds of
life into which mechanical labour enters, are forces
which every year drive the multitudes farther and
farther from its primitive tenets. In a small, and a
poor, community Christianity may be a creed possible
in its practical realisation, and consistent in its
simplicity of existence; but in the mad world of
modern life, with its overwhelming wealth and its
overwhelming poverty, with its horrible satiety and
its horrible hunger, with its fiendish greed and its
ghastly crimes, its endless lusts and its cruel bitterness
of hatreds, Christianity can only be one of two
things—either a nullity, as it is now in all national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>life, or a dynamic force allied with and ruling through
socialism, and destroying all civilisation as it, at
present, stands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Which will it be? There is no prophet to say.
But whichever it be, there will be that in its future
which, if it remain dominant, will make the cry of
the poet the sigh of Humanity:</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>THE PASSING OF PHILOMEL</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>Will there ever be a world in which the voice
of Sappho’s bird will be no longer heard?</p>

<p class='c001'>I fear it.</p>

<p class='c001'>For thrice a thousand years, to our knowledge, that
divine music, the sweetest of any music upon earth,
has been eloquent in the woods and the gardens of
every springtime, renewing its song as the earth her
youth. The nightingale has ever been the poet’s
darling; is indeed poetry incarnated; love, vocal and
spiritual, made manifest. Nothing surely can show
the deadness, dulness, coarseness, coldness of the
human multitude so plainly as their indifference to
this exquisite creature. Do even people who call
themselves cultured care for the nightingale? How
do they care? They rise from their dinner-table and
stroll out on to a terrace or down an avenue, and
there in the moonlight listen for a few moments, and
say ‘How charming!’ then return to their flirtations,
their theatricals, their baccarat or their bézique within
doors. Bulbul may sing all night amongst the roses
and the white heads of the lilies; they will not go out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>again. They prefer the cushioned lounge, the electric
light, the tumbler of iced drink, the playing cards, the
spiced <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>double entendre</i></span>. Here and there a woman may
sit at her open casement half the night, or a poet
walk entranced through the leafy lanes till dawn, but
these listeners are few and far between.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Nature gave this gift to the world she might
well have looked for some slight gratitude. But save
when Sappho has listened, or Meleager, or Shakespeare,
or Ford, or Musset, or Shelley, or Lytton, who
has cared? Not one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Possibly, if the nightingale had been born once in a
century, rarity might have secured for it attention, protection,
appreciation. But singing everywhere, as it
has done, wherever the climate was fit for it, through
so many hundreds and hundreds of years, it has
been almost wholly neglected by the soulless and
dull ears of man.</p>

<p class='c001'>A slender, bright and agile bird, the nightingale
is neither shy nor useless, as it is said that most poets
and musicians are. It eats grubs, worms, lice, small
insects of all kinds, and hunts amongst the decaying
leaves and grass for many a garden pest, with active
energy and industry, qualities too often lacking to the
human artist. It builds a loose, roomy nest, often
absolutely on the ground, and always placed with
entire confidence in man’s good faith. It is a very
happy bird, and its song is the most ecstatic hymn
of joy. I never can imagine how it came to be
associated with sorrow and tragedy, and the ghastly
story of Procne and Itys. For rapturous happiness
there is nothing to be compared to the full love-song
of the nightingale. All other music is harsh, cold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>dissonant, beside it. But, alas! the full perfection
of the song is not always heard. For it to sing its
fullest, its richest, its longest, it must have been in
peace and security, it must have been left untroubled
and unalarmed, it must have its little heart at rest in
its leafy home. Where the nightingale is harassed,
and affrighted, and disturbed, its song is quite different
to what it is when in happiness and tranquillity; where
it feels alarmed and insecure it never acquires its full
song, the note is shorter and weaker, and the magnificent,
seemingly unending, trills are never heard, for
the bird sings as though it were afraid of being heard
and hunted—which, indeed, no doubt it is.</p>

<p class='c001'>When entirely secure from any interference, year
after year in the same spot (for, if not interfered with,
it returns unerringly to the same haunts), many
families will come to the same place together, and
the males call and shout to each other in the most
joyous emulation day and night. Under these conditions
alone does the marvellous music of the nightingale
reach its full height and eloquence. No one
who has not heard the song under these conditions
can judge of it as it is in its perfection: the strength
of it, the rapture of it, the long-sustained, breathless
tremulo, the wondrous roulades and arpeggios, the
exquisite liquid sweetness, surpassing in beauty every
other sound on earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>In one spot, dearer to me than any upon earth,
where the old stones once felt the tread of the
armoured guards and the cuirassed priests of the great
Countess Matilda, the nightingales have nested and
sung by dozens in the bay and arbutus of the undergrowth
of the woods, and under the wild roses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>pomegranates fringing the meadows. On one nook
of grass land alone I have seen seven close together
at daybreak, hunting for their breakfasts amongst the
dewy blades, in amicable rivalry. Here they have
come with the wild winds of March ever since
Matilda’s reign, and for many ages before that, when
all which is now the vale of Arno was forest and
marsh. Here, because long protected and beloved,
they sing in the most marvellous concert, challenging
and answering each other in a riot of melody more
exquisite than any orchestra created by man can
produce; the long ecstasy pouring through the
ardours of full noonday, or across the silver radiance
of the moon; saluting the dawn with joyous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Io
triomphe!</i></span> or praising the starry glories of the night
with a rapturous <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Salve Regina!</i></span></p>

<p class='c001'>The hawks sweep through the sun rays, the owls
flash through the shadows, but the nightingales sing
on, fearless and unharmed; it is only man they dread,
and man cannot hurt them here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Naturalists state that the nightingale does not
attain to the uttermost splendour of its voice until
the eighth or ninth year of its life, and that the songsters
of that age give lessons to the younger ones.
To the truth of this latter fact I can vouch from
personal observation, but I doubt so many years
being required to develop the song to perfection. I
think its perfection is dependent, as I have said, on
the peace and security which the singer enjoys; on
its familiarity with its nesting haunts, and on the
sense of safety which it enjoys. This may be said, in
a measure, of the song of all birds; but it is especially
true of the nightingale, which is one of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>sensitive and highly organised of sentient beings, and
one, moreover, with intense affections, devoted to its
mate, its offspring and its chosen home.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will be objected to me that nightingales sing in
captivity. They do so; but the song of the caged
nightingale is intolerable to the ear which is used to
the song of the free bird in wood and field and
garden. It is not the same song; it has changed its
character: it sounds like one long agonised note of
appeal, and this indeed we may be certain that it is.</p>

<p class='c001'>I confess that I hold many crimes which are punishable
by the felon’s dock less infamous than the
caging of nightingales, or indeed the caging of any
winged creatures. Migratory birds, caged, suffer yet
more than any, because, in addition to the loss of
liberty, they suffer from the repression of those
natural instincts of flight at certain periods of the
year, which denial must torture them to an extent
quite immeasurable by us. The force of the migratory
instinct may be imagined by the fact that it is
intense and dominant enough to impel a creature so
small, so timid, and so defenceless as a song-bird to
incur the greatest perils, and wing its unprotected
way across seas and continents, mountains and deserts,
from Europe to Asia or Africa, in a flight which is
certainly one of the most marvellous of the many
marvels of Nature to which men are so dully and so
vain-gloriously indifferent. The intensity of the impelling
power may be gauged by the miracle of its
results; and the bird in whom this instinct is
repressed and denied must suffer incredible agonies
of longing and vain effort, as from unfit climate and
from unchanged food. No one, I am sure, can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>measure the torture endured by migratory birds from
these causes when in captivity. Russian women of
the world are very fond of taking back to Russia
with them nightingales of Southern Europe, for which
they pay a high price: these birds invariably die
after a week or two in Russia, but the abominable
practice continues unchecked. Nightingales are
captured or killed indiscriminately with other birds
in all the countries where they nest, and no one seems
alive to the shameless barbarity of such a sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c001'>With every year their chosen haunts are more
and more invaded by the builder, the cultivator,
the trapper, the netter. Nightingales will nest contentedly
in gardens where they are unmolested, but
their preference is for wild ground, or at least for leafy
shrubberies and thickets: the dense hedges of clipped
bay or arbutus common to Italy are much favoured
by them. Therefore the nudity characteristic of high
farming is fatal to them: to Philomel and her brood
shadow and shelter are a necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where I dwell, much is still unaltered since the days
of Horace and Virgil. The ‘silvery circle’ of the
reaping-hook still flashes amongst the bending wheat.
The oxen still slowly draw the wooden plough up and
down the uneven fields. The osiers still turn to
gold above the flag-filled streamlets; the barefooted
peasants run through the flower-filled grass; the
cherries and plums tumble uncounted amongst the
daisies; the soft, soundless wings of swallow and owl
and kestrel fan the air, as they sweep down from the
old red-brown tiles of the roofs where they make their
homes; the corn is threshed by flails in the old way
on the broad stone courts; the vine and ash and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>peach and maple grow together, graceful and careless;
the patient ass turns in the circular path of the
stone olive-press; the huge, round-bellied jars, the
amphoræ of old, stand beside the horse-block at the
doors; the pigeons flash above the bean-fields and
feast as they will; the great walnut trees throw their
shade over the pumpkins and the maize; men and
women and children still work and laugh, and lounge
at noon amongst the sheaves, thank the gods, much
as they did when Theocritus ate honey by the fountain’s
brink. But how long will this be so? How
long will the Italy of Virgil and Horace be left to us?</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the brutality of chemical agriculture the
whole face of the world is changing. The England
of Gilbert White and Thomas Bewick is going as the
England of the Tudors went before it; and the
France of the Bourbons is being effaced like the
France of the Valois. The old hedgerow timber is
felled. The cowslip meadows are turned into great
grazing grounds. The high flowering hedges are cut
to the root, or often stubbed up entirely, and their
place filled by galvanised wire fencing. The wildflowers
cannot blossom on the naked earth; so disappear.
The drained soil has no longer any place for
the worts and the rushes and the fennels and the
water spurges. Instead of the beautiful old lichen-grown
orchard trees, bending to the ground under the
weight of their golden or russet balls, there are rows
of grafts two feet high, bearing ponderous, flavourless
prize fruits, or monotonous espaliers grimly trimmed
and trained, with shot bullfinches or poisoned blackbirds
lying along their ugly length.</p>

<p class='c001'>The extreme greed which characterises agriculture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and horticulture, as it characterises all other pursuits
in modern times, will inevitably cause the gradual
extermination of all living things which it is considered
possible may interfere with the maximum
of profit. In the guano-dressed, phosphate-dosed,
chemically-treated fields and gardens of the future,
with their vegetables and fruits ripened by electric
light, and their colouring and flavouring obtained by
the artificial aids of the laboratory, there will be no
place for piping linnet, rose-throated robin, gay
chaffinch, tiny tit, or blue warbler; and none amidst
the frames, the acids, the manures, the machines, the
hydraulic engines, for Philomel. The object of the
gardener and the farmer is to produce: the garden
and the farm will soon be mere factories of produce,
ugly and sordid, like all other factories.</p>

<p class='c001'>The vast expanses of unbroken corn lands and grazing
lands, to be seen in modern England, have no
leafy nooks, as the fields of Herrick, of Wordsworth,
of Tennyson’s earlier time had for them. In Italy and
in France the acids, phosphates, sublimates, and other
chemicals, poured over vineyards and farm lands drive
away the nightingale, which used to nest so happily
under the low-growing vine leaves, or amongst the
endive and parsley. ‘The lands are never left at
peace,’ said a peasant to me not long ago; and the
peace of the birds is gone with that of the fields: the
fates of both are intimately interwoven and mutually
dependent. Where the orchard and the vineyard are
still what they were of old—green, fragrant, dusky,
happy places, full of sweet scents and of sweet sounds—there
the birds still are happy. But in the newfangled
fields, acid-drenched, sulphur-powdered, sulphate-poisoned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>stripped bare and jealously denuded
of all alien life, winged and wild animals, hunted and
harassed, can have no place. Scientific husbandry
has sacrificed the simple joys of rural life, and with
them the lives of the birds. ‘What shall it profit
a man if he gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?’ has been asked by the wisdom of old.
The song of the birds is the voice of the soul of
Nature, and men stifle it for sake of avarice and
greed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three or four years ago the village of San Domenico,
on the highway to Fiesole, was a green nest
which in spring was filled with the music of nightingales;
the fields, with the wild-rose hedges, were one
paradise of song in springtime and early summer.
The old villa, which stands with its big trees between
the little streams of Africa and Mensola, where Walter
Savage Landor lived and where he wished to be
allowed to die, was hidden away under its deep cedar
shadows, and the nightingales day and night sang
amongst its narcissi and its jonquils. An American
came, bought and ruined. He could let nothing
alone. He had no sentiment or perception. He
built a new glaring wing, spoiling all the symmetry of
the old tenement, daubed over with new stucco and
colour the beautiful old hues of the ancient walls, cut
down trees by the old shady gateway, and built a
porter’s lodge after the manner beloved of Hampstead
and of Clapham. He considers himself a man
of taste; he is (I am ashamed to say) a scholar! It
would have been less affront to the memory of Landor,
and to the spirits haunting this poetic, historic,
legendary place, to have razed the house to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>ground, and have let the grass grow over it as over
grave.</p>

<p class='c001'>Higher up, but quite near, on the same hillside as
the villa of Landor, there stood a stone house, old,
solid, coloured with the beautiful greys and browns
of age; it had at one side a stone staircase leading up
to a sculptured and painted shrine, before it were grass
terraces with some bamboos, some roses, some laurels
and beneath these a lower garden which joined the
fields and blended with them. It was quite perfect in
its own simple, ancient way. A year ago the dreadful
hand of the improver seized on it, daubed it over
with staring stucco, painted and varnished its woodwork,
stuck vulgar green <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>persiennes</i></span> in its old casements,
and, in a word, made it as nearly as possible
resemble the pert, paltry, staring, gimcrack structure
of a modern villa. It is now a blot on the hillside,
an eyesore to the wayfarer, an offence to the sight and
to the landscape; and the nightingales, which were
so eloquent on its grass terraces, go to its rosebushes
and bamboos no more.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such treatment as this of secluded places scares
away the little brown lover of the moon: where there
are brought all the pother and dust of masons’, carpenters’
and painters’ work, the voice of Philomel
cannot be heard; the sweet solitude of the rose
thicket is invaded by uncouth din and vulgar uproar;
the cedar shadows lie no more unbroken on the
untrodden sward; the small scops owl flits no more
at evening through the perfumed air, the big white
owl can nest no more beneath the moss-grown tiles
and timbers of the roof; all the soft, silent, shy
creatures of fur and feather, which have been happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>so long, are startled, terrified, driven away for ever,
and the nightingale dare nest no more. It is impossible
to measure the injury done to the half-wild, half-tame
denizens of the woods and gardens by the mania
for restoration and innovation which characterises the
purchasers and the tenants of the present day.</p>

<p class='c001'>One such ghastly renovation as this, which has
vulgarised and ruined the Landor villa and its neighbour,
causes an amount of havoc to the creatures of
the brake and bush which can never be repaired.
Once frightened and driven out, they never come back
again. They are the youth of the world; and, like
all youth, once gone, they are gone for ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>The builder who desecrated these places, the people
who live in them, do not perceive the abomination
which they have wrought; and if they were called to
account, would stare at their accuser, understanding
nothing of their sin. Are there not an admirably
grained and varnished hall door, and window shutters
of the brightest pistachio green? What matter if
Philomel nest no more under the cuckoopint and
burdock? Is there not the scream of the tramway
whistle? What matter if the Madonna’s herb grow
no longer on the old stone steps and the swallow
build no more under the hanging eaves? Are there
not the painted boards declaring, in letters a foot
long, that the adjacent land is to be let or sold for
building purposes?</p>

<p class='c001'>By the increase of bricks and mortar, and the sterility
and nudity which accompany scientific agriculture,
the nightingale is everywhere being driven
higher into the hills, where it may still hope to nest
unmolested, but where the temperature is unsuited to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>it. Its breeding grounds become, with every season,
fewer and more difficult to find. It is sociable, and
would willingly be at home in the gardens even of
cities; but men will not leave it in peace there. Its
nests are taken and its feeding grounds are destroyed
by the over-sweeping and over-weeding of the modern
gardener. The insensate modern practice of clearing
away all leaves as they fall from the soil of shrubberies
and avenues starves the nightingales, as it
starves the roots of the trees. When the leaves are
left to lie through the winter the trees rejoice in their
warmth and nourishment, and the returning birds find
a rich larder in the spring. A carpet of golden leaves
is a lovely and useful thing; but the modern gardener
does not think so, and his intolerable birch broom,
and yet more intolerable mechanical sweeper, tears
away the precious veil which Nature’s care would
spread in preservation over the chilly earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Starved, hunted, robbed of its nest, and harassed
in its song, the nightingale must therefore inevitably
grow rarer and rarer every year.</p>

<p class='c001'>The vile tramways, which have unrolled their
hideous length over so many thousands of miles all
over Europe, bring the noise, the glare, and the dirt
of cities into the once peaceful solitude of hill and
valley. They are at this moment being made through
the beautiful forest roads of the Jura!</p>

<p class='c001'>The curse of the town is being spread broadcast
over the face of the country, as the filth of urban
cesspools is being carried out over rustic fields. The
sticks, the guns, the nets, the traps, the birdlime of
the accursed bird destroyer, are carried by train and
tram into the green heart of once tranquil wolds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>woods. The golden gorse serves to shelter the
grinning excursionist, the wild hyacinths are crushed
under the wine flasks and the beer bottles. The
lowest forms of human life leave the slums and
ravage the virgin country; ten thousand jarring
wheels carry twenty thousand clumsy, greedy hands
to tear down the wild honeysuckle and pull to pieces
the bird’s nest, to tear up the meadow-sweet and
strangle the green lizard. The curse of the town
mounts higher and higher and higher every year, and
clings like a vampire to the country, and sucks out
of it all its beauty, and stifles in it all its song.</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon the hiss of the engine and the bray of the
cad will be the only sounds heard throughout Europe.
It is very probable that the conditions of human life
in the future will be incompatible with the existence
of the nightingale at all. It is almost certain that
all natural beauty, all woodland solitude, all sylvan
quiet, will be year by year more and more attacked,
diminished, and disturbed, until the lives of all
creatures which depend on these will come altogether
to an end.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us imagine what the world was like when
Sappho heard the nightingales of Greece, and we can
then measure by our own present loss what will be
the probable loss of future generations; the atmosphere
was then of a perfect purity; no coal smoke
soiled the air or blurred the sea; no engine hissed,
no cogwheel whirred, no piston throbbed; the sweet
wild country ran to the very gates of the small cities;
there was no tread noisier than the footfall of the
ox upon the turf; there was no artificial light harsher
than the pale soft gleam of the olive oil, the temples
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>were white as the snow on Ida, and the brooks and
the fountains were clear as the sparkling smile of
the undimmed day. In such a world every tuft of
thyme and every bough of laurel had its nest,
and under the radiant skies the song of the nightingales
must have been eloquent over all the plains
and hills in one unbroken flood of joy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us picture the fairness of the world as it was
then, with undimmed skies, unpolluted waters, untouched
forests, and untainted air; and we must
realise that what is called civilisation has given us
nothing worth that which it has taken, and will
continue to take away from us, forever.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>THE ITALY OF TO-DAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>Cavallotti<a id='rC' /><a href='#fC' class='c015'><sup>[C]</sup></a> has written, in his letter of protest
against the arrest of the Sicilian deputy,
De Felice, a sentence which deserves to be repeated
all over the land: one of those sentences, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>multum in
parvo</i></span>, which resume a whole situation in a phrase: he
has written: <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘Invece che del pane si da il piombo.’</span>
Instead of bread to the suffering and famished multitudes
there is offered lead, the lead of rifle bullets and
of cannon-balls. That is the only response which
has as yet been given to demands which are in the
main essentially just. Is the English public aware
that the Italian city of Caltanissetta has been, the
first week of the year, bombarded by Italian artillery,
and that in that town alone six hundred arrests have
been made in one day? If this were taking place
in Poland the English public and its press would be
convulsed with rage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of the press in England towards the
present Italian struggle against overwhelming fiscal
burdens is so singular that it can only be attributed
to one of two things: Bourse interests or German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>influence. All that is said in the English press concerning
Italian affairs is at all times marked by
singular ineptitude and inaccuracy; but at the present
crisis it is conspicuous for a resolute and unblushing
concealment of facts. The unfortunate flattery which
has been poured out on Italy by the German press
and Parliament for their emperor’s ends, and by the
English press and Parliament out of hatred of France,
has been taken for gospel truth by the Quirinale, the
Palazzo Braschi, and every deputy and editor from
Alps to Etna, and has fed the natural vanity of the
Italian disposition, until, in a rude awakening, the
whole nation finds itself on the brink of bankruptcy
and anarchy.</p>

<p class='c001'>To all conversant with the true state and real needs
of the country ever since the death of Victor Emmanuel,
the language of the German and English
press and Parliaments has seemed almost insane in its
optimism, as it has been most cruel in its fulsome
falsehood. Much of the present woe may be
attributed to it; for if Berlin and London had not
taken, or pretended to take, Messer Francesco Crispi
for a statesman, it is very possible that that ingenious
lawyer might never have dragged his sovereign into
the meshes of the Triple Alliance and the Slough of
Despond of a bottomless debt. That unintelligent
and interested flattery is as injurious to nations as to
individuals and gives them vertigo, is a truth too
frequently forgotten or purposely disregarded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps one of the oddest and least admirable
traits in the public opinion of the latest half of this
century is its absolute unconsciousness of its own
caprices and inconsequence; its entire ignorance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>how flatly its assertions of to-day contradict those of
yesterday and will be contradicted by those of to-morrow.
History has accustomed us to such transmogrifications,
and we know that power is potent to
turn the insurgent into the reactionist, but certainly
the drollest and most picturesque episode in connection
with the Sicilian revolution is the arrest of the
deputy De Felice, for inciting to civil war, coupled
with the fact that the last deputy arrested for precisely
the same cause was Francesco Crispi at the
time of Aspromonte! History, in all its length and
breadth, does not furnish us with any droller antithesis
than that of Crispi as arrested and Crispi as arrester.
The Italian press has contented itself with merely
stating the circumstances, and letting them speak for
themselves; the European press does not appear even
to be aware of them. For the European press, with
the exception of the French, the Crispi of Aspromonte
is dead and buried, as the Crispi of Montecitorio and
the Quirinale would desire that he should be. The
prostration of the English press in especial before
the latter is infinitely comical to those who know the
real career of the fortunate Sicilian notary who began
life as a penniless republican, and is ending it as a
plutocrat, a reactionist, and a Knight of the Order of
the Association. It is probable that Europe on the
whole knows but little of the Crispi of Aspromonte;
it is possible that De Felice and his friends will cause
it to know more. Falstaff abjuring cakes and ale,
and putting two mirthful roysterers in the pillory,
would present the only companion picture worthy of
comparison with the Crispi of Montecitorio gravely
defending the seizure of the leader of the Fasci on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>score that the offence of the latter is <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>lesa alla patria</i></span>.
Why is revolutionary effort in ’93 and ’94 treason to
the country when revolutionary effort in ’59 and ’48
was, we are taught by all Italian text-books, the most
admirable patriotism? It is a plain question which
will never be honoured by an answer. Crispi of
Montecitorio does not condescend to reason; he finds
it easier to use cannon and bayonets, as they were
used against that Crispi of Aspromonte of whom he
considers it ill-bred in anyone to remind him. Crispi
understands the present era; he knows that it does
not punish, or even notice, such inconsistencies, at
least when they are the inconsistencies of successful
men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were the national sense of humour as quick as it
was in the days of Pulci and Boiardo this circumstance
would be fatal to the dictatorship of the ex-revolutionist.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the national litany of Italy the chief of gods
invoked are Mazzini, Ugo Foscolo, Garibaldi, Manini,
and a score of others of the same persuasion, and all
the present generation (outside what are termed Black
Society and Codini Circles) are reared in religious
veneration of such names. Now, it does not matter
in the least whether this veneration be well or ill
founded, be wise or unwise; it has been taught to all
the present youth and manhood of all liberal-minded
Italian families as a duty, a pleasure, and a creed in
one. What sense is there in blaming this multitude
if they carry out their own principles to a logical conclusion,
and refuse to see that the opinions which
were noble and heroic in their fathers become treason
and crime in themselves? The House of Savoy, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>a lucky chance for itself, drew the biggest prize in the
lottery of national events in 1859; but it was not to
place the House of Savoy on the Italian throne that
Garibaldi fought, and Mazzini conspired, and a host
of heroes died in battle or in exile. To all those
whose names are like trumpet-calls to us still, the
merging of their ideal of United Italy into a mere royal
state must have seemed bathos, must have caused the
most cruel and heartbreaking disillusion. They accepted
it because at the time, rightly or wrongly, they
considered that they could do no less; but they suffered,
as all must suffer who have cherished high and
pure dreams and behold what is called the realisation
of them in the common clay of ordinary circumstance.</p>

<p class='c001'>No one can pretend that the chief makers of the
union of the country were monarchical. They were
Red; and were hunted, imprisoned, exiled, shot for
the colour of their opinions, precisely in the same
manner as the leaders of the Fasci and the deputies
of the Extreme Left are being dealt with now.
Measures of this kind are excusable in absolute or
arbitrary governments, such as Russia or Prussia;
but in a State which owes its very existence to revolutionary
forces, they are an anomaly. It is truly the
sad and sorry spectacle of the son turning on and
strangling the father who begat him.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the present date Italy is a military tyranny. It
is useless to deny the fact. Many parts of the
country are in a state of siege, as though actually
invaded and conquered; and although recent events
are alleged in excuse for this, it is by no means the
first time that the army has been used for the suffocation
of all public expression of feeling. Arbitrary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and unexplained arrest has always been frequent;
and when the sovereigns visit any city or town the
gaols thereof have always been filled on the vigil of
the visit with crowds of persons suspected of democratic
or dangerous tendencies. A rigid censorship
of telegrams has long existed, as inquisitorial as any
censorship of an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ancien régime</i></span>; and at the present
moment telegrams from Sicily are absolutely forbidden
to be despatched. Wholesale invasion of the
privacy of private houses takes place at the pleasure
of the police, and seizure of private letters and papers
follows at the caprice of the Questura.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where is there any pretext of liberty? In what
does the absolutism of 1894 differ from that of the
Bourbon, or of the Este-Lorraine? In what sense can
a Free Italy be said to exist? The Gallophobia now
so general amongst English political speakers and
writers may account for the determination in them
to applaud the Italian Government, alike when it is
wrong as when it is right; but it is quite certain that,
whatever be the motive, the English press has, with
very few exceptions, combined to hide from the
English public the true circumstances and causes of a
revolution which, however to be deplored in its excesses,
is not a whit more blameable, or less interesting
and excusable than the other revolutions of Italy
which filled England with such delight and sympathy.
The kingdom of Italy was created by revolution.
As the life of a nation counts, it was but yesterday
that Garibaldi’s red shirt was pushed through
the gates of Stafford House, narrowly escaping
being torn to rags by the admiring and enthusiastic
crowds of London. To the philosophic observer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>there is something extremely illogical in the present
denunciation of men who are now doing nothing
more than Garibaldi did with the applause of Europe
and America. To set up statues in every public
square to Garibaldi, and imprison Garibaldi Bosco,
and charge with high treason De Felice Giuffrida,
is a nonsense to which it is difficult to render
homage.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is well known that the King, unconstitutionally,
refused to accept the Zanardelli Ministry because it
would have led to reduction of the army, and, as
a necessary consequence, to withdrawal from the
German incubus. He is possessed with a mania for
German influences; influences, of all others, the most
fatal to public freedom and political liberty. Nothing
in the whole world could have been so injurious to
Italy as to fall, as she has done, under the mailed
hand of the brutal Prussian example and exactions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Germany has always been fatal to Italy, and always
will be. The costly armaments which have made her
penniless are due to Germany. Her army and navy
receive annual and insulting inspection by Prussian
princes. The time will probably come when German
troops will be asked to preserve ‘social order’ in the
cities and provinces of Italy. So long as the German
alliance continues in its present form, so long will this
danger for Italy always exist, that, in the event of the
Italian army proving insufficient, or unwilling, to
quell revolution, the timidity or despotism of Italian
rulers may beg the aid of Germany to do so.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the manifesto of the Extreme Left, after the fall
of Giolitti, the state of the country was described in
language forcible but entirely true.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>‘Commerce is stagnant, bankruptcy general, savings
are seized, small proprietors succumb under fiscal
exactions, agriculture languishes, stifled under taxation,
emigration is increased in an alarming proportion
to the population, the municipalities squander
and become penniless; the country, in taxes of various
kinds, pays no less than seventy per cent., <i>i.e.</i>,
four or five times as much as is paid by rich nations.
The material taxable diminishes every day, because
production is paralysed in its most vital parts, and
misery has shrunken consumption; in a word, the
whole land is devoured by military exactions and the
criminal folly of a policy given over to interests and
ambitions which totally ignore the true necessities of
the people. The hour is come to cry, “Hold,
enough!” and to oblige the State not to impose
burdens, but to make atonement.’</p>

<p class='c001'>There is nothing exaggerated in these statements;
they are strictly moderate, and understate the truth.
The Extreme Left may or may not be Socialistic, but
in its manifesto it is entirely within the truth, and describes
with moderation a state of national suffering
and penury which would render pardonable the
greatest violence of language.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Extreme Left affirms with the strictest truth
that its members have never contributed to bring
about the present misery, and are in no degree responsible
for it. The entire responsibility lies with
corrupt administration, and with military tyranny and
extravagance.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a people are stripped bare, and reduced
to destitution, can it be expected, should it be
dreamed, that they can keep their souls in patience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>when fresh taxes threaten them, and the hideous
Juggernauth of military expenditure rolls over their
ruined lives?</p>

<p class='c001'>Italians have been too long deluded with the
fables of men in office; and many years too long,
patient under the intolerable exactions laid upon
them. It is not only the imperial, but the municipal
tyrannies which destroy them; they are between the
devil and the deep sea; what the State does not take
the Commune seizes. The most onerous and absurd
fines await every trifling sin of omission or commission,
every insignificant, unimportant, little forgetfulness
leads to a penalty ridiculously disproportioned
to the trifling offence—a little dust swept on to the
pavement, a dog running loose, a cart left before a
door, a guitar played in the street, a siesta taken
under a colonnade, a lemon or a melon sold without
permit to trade being previously purchased and registered,
some infinitesimal trifle—for which the offender
is dragged before the police and the municipal clerks,
and mulcted in sums of three, five, ten, twenty, or
thirty francs. Frequently a fine of two francs is
quite enough to ruin the hapless offender. If he
cannot pay he goes to prison.</p>

<p class='c001'>The imperial tax of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ricchezza mobile</i></span> is levied on
the poorest; often the bed has to be sold or the
saucepans pawned to pay it. The pawning institutes
are State affairs; their fee is nine per cent., and the
goods are liable to be sold in a year. In France the
fee is four per cent., and the goods are not liable to
be sold for three years. When a poor person has
scraped the money together to pay the fees, the
official (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>stimatore</i></span>) often declares that the article
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>is more worthless than he thought, and claims a
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>calo</i></span> of from ten to a hundred francs, according to
his caprice; if the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>calo</i></span> be not paid the object is sold,
though the nine per cent. for the past year may have
been paid on it. The gate-tax, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>dazio consumo</i></span>, best
known to English ears as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>octroi</i></span>, which has been the
especial object of the Sicilian fury, is a curse to the
whole land. Nothing can pass the gates of any city
or town without paying this odious and inquisitorial
impost. Strings of cattle and of carts wait outside
from midnight to morning, the poor beasts lying
down in the winter mud and summer dust. Half
the life of the country people is consumed in this
senseless stoppage and struggle at the gates; a poor
old woman cannot take a few eggs her hen has
laid, or a bit of spinning she has done, through the
gates without paying for them. The wretched live
chickens and ducks, geese and turkeys, wait half a
day and a whole night cooped up in stifling crates
or hung neck downwards in a bunch on a nail; the
oxen and calves are kept without food three or four
days before their passage through the gates, that
they may weigh less when put in the scales. By
this insensate method of taxation all the food taken
into the cities and towns is deteriorated. The prating
and interfering officers of hygiene do not attend
to this, the greatest danger of all to health, <i>i.e.</i>,
inflamed and injured carcasses of animals and poultry
sent as food into the markets.</p>

<p class='c001'>The municipalities exact the last centime from
their prey; whole families are ruined and disappear
through the exactions of their communes, who
persist in squeezing what is already drained dry as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>a bone. The impious and insensate destruction of
ancient quarters and noble edifices goes on because
the municipal councillors, and engineers, and contractors
fatten on it. The cost to the towns is enormous,
the damage done is eternal, the debt incurred
is incalculable, the loss to art and history immeasurable,
but the officials who strut their little hour on
the communal stage make their profits, and no one
cares a straw how the city, town, or village suffer.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the Italian States could have been united like
the United States of America, and made strictly
neutral like Belgium, their condition would have been
much simpler, happier, and less costly. As a monarchy,
vanity and display have ruined the country,
while the one supreme advantage which she might
have enjoyed, that of keeping herself free to remain
the courted of all, she has wilfully and stupidly
thrown away, by binding herself, hand and foot,
almost in vassalage, to Prussia. For this, there can
be no doubt, unfortunately, that the present King
is mainly responsible; and, strange to say, he does
not even seem to be sensible of the magnitude of the
evil of his act.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is as certain as any event which has not happened
can be, that nothing of what has now come
to pass would have occurred but for the disastrous
folly which has made the Government of Italy strain
to become what is called a Great Power, and conclude
alliances of which the unalterable condition has been
a standing army of as vast extent as the expenditure
for its maintenance is enormous. There is nothing
abnormal in the present ruin of the country, nothing
which cannot easily be traced to its cause, nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>which could not have been avoided by prudence, by
modesty, and by renunciation. As the pitiful vanity
and ambition to reach a higher grade than that which
is naturally theirs beggars private individuals, so the
craze to be equal with the largest empire, and to make
an equal military and naval display with theirs, has
caused a drain on the resources of the country, a pitiless
pressure upon the most powerless and hopeless
classes, which have spread misery broadcast over the
land.</p>

<p class='c001'>It might be deplorable, unwise, possibly thankless,
if the country dismissed the House of Savoy; but
in so doing the country would be wholly within its
rights. The act would be in no sense whatever <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lesa
alla patria</i></span>; it might, on the contrary, be decided
on, and carried out, through the very truest patriotism.
The error of the House of Savoy is the same
error as that of the House of Bonaparte; they forget
that what has been given by a plebiscite, a later
plebiscite has every right and faculty to withdraw.
The English nation, when it put William of Orange
on the throne, would have been as entirely within its
rights and privileges had it put him down from it.
When a sovereign accepts a crown from the vote of a
majority, he must in reason admit that another larger
and later majority can withdraw it from his keeping.
A plebiscite cannot confer Divine Right. It cannot
either confer any inalienable right at all. It is, therefore,
entirely illogical and unjust to visit the endeavour
and desire to make Italy a republic as a crime of
high treason. An Italian has as much right to wish
for a republican form of government, and to do what
he can to bring it about, as the Americans of the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>century had to struggle against the taxation of
George III. And if the Casa Savoia be driven from
the Quirinale, it will owe this loss of power entirely
to its own policy, which has impoverished the nation
beyond all endurance. The present King’s lamentable
and inexplicable infatuation for the German
alliance, and all the frightful expenditure and sacrifice
to which this fatal alliance has led, have brought
the country to its present ruin.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the moment at which these lines are written,
the flames of revolution are destroying the public
buildings of the city of Bari; before even these lines
can be printed, who shall say that these flames may
not have spread to every town in the Peninsula? Of
course, the present revolts may be crushed by sheer
armed force; but if a reign of terror paralyse the
movement for awhile, if a military despotism crush
and gag the life out of Palermo and Naples and
Rome, as it has been crushed and gagged by similar
means in Warsaw and in Moscow, the causes which
have led to revolution will continue to exist, and its
fires will but die down awhile, to break forth in greater
fury in a near future. The Crispi of Montecitorio is
now busy throwing into prison all over the country a
large number of citizens, for doing precisely the same
things as the Crispi of Aspromonte did himself, or
endeavoured to do. But in the present age a man
may abjure and ignore his own past with impunity.
As it is always perfectly useless to refute Mr Gladstone’s
statements by quotations from his own earlier
utterances, so it would be quite useless to hope to
embarrass the Italian premier by any reminder of
his own younger and revolutionary self. Renegades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>always are impervious to sarcasm, and pachydermatous
against all reproach.</p>

<p class='c001'>Crispi is very far from a great man in any sense of
those words, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Au pays des aveugles le borgne est roi</i></span>,
and he has had the supreme good fortune to have
outlived all Italian men of eminence. If Cavour and
Victor Emmanuel were living still, or even Sella and
Minghetti and La Marmora, it is extremely probable
that the costly amusement of making Crispi of
Aspromonte First Minister of the Crown would
never have been amongst the freaks of fate. He
has had ‘staying power,’ and so has buried all those
who would have kept him in his proper place. It is
possible that if he had adhered to his earlier creeds
he might have been by this time President of an
Italian Republic, for his intelligence is keen and
versatile, and his audacity is great and elastic. But
he has preferred the more prosperous and less glorious
career of a minister and a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>maire du palais</i></span>. He
has emerged with amazing insolence from financial
discredit which would have made any other man
ashamed to face the social and political worlds; and,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mirabile dictu!</i></span> having dragged his King and country
into an abyss of poverty, shame and misery, he is still
adored by the one and suffered to domineer over the
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>Successful in the vulgar sense of riches, of decorations,
of temporary power, and of overweening Court
favour, the Sicilian man of law is; successful in the
higher sense of statesmanship, and the consolation of
a suffering nation, he never will be. And that he has
been permitted to return to power is painful proof of
the weakness of will and the moral degradation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the country. There is no great man in Italy at the
present hour, no man with the magnetism of Garibaldi,
or the intellect of D’Azeglio, or even the
rough martial talent of Victor Emmanuel, and in the
absence of such the sly, subtle, fox-like lawyers, by
whom the country is overrun, come to the front, and
add one curse more to the many curses already lying
on the head of Leopardi’s beloved Mater Dolorosa.
It is possible that, for want of a man of genius who
would be able to gather into one the scattered forces,
and fuse them into irresistible might by that magic
which genius alone possesses, the cause of liberty will
be once more lost in Italy. If such a leader do not
appear, the present movement, which is not a revolt
but a revolution in embryo, will probably be trampled
out by armed despotism, and the present terror of
the ruling classes of Europe before the bugbear of
anarchy will be appealed to in justification of the refusal
to a ruined people of the reforms and the atonement
which they have, with full right, demanded.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>BLIND GUIDES</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>Amongst the famous gardens of the world, the
Orti Oricellari<a id='rD' /><a href='#fD' class='c015'><sup>[D]</sup></a> must take a foremost place,
alike for sylvan beauty and for intellectual tradition.
Second only to the marvellous gardens of Rome, they
were first, for loveliness and for association, amongst
the many great and carefully-cultured gardens which
once adorned Tuscany. Under the Rucellai their
superb groves and glades sheltered the most intellectual
meetings which Florence has ever seen. The
Società Oricellari (which continued that imitation
of the Platonic Academy created by Cosimo and
Lorenzo) assembled here under the shade of the
great forest trees. Here Machiavelli read aloud his
Art of War, and here Giovanni Rucellai composed
his Rosamunda. The house built for Bernardo
Rucellai by Leon Battista Alberti was a treasure-house
of art, ancient and contemporary; and learning,
literature and philosophy found their meet home
under the ilex and cedar shadows, and in the fragrant
air of the orange and myrtle boughs. High thoughts
and scholarly creation were never more fitly housed
than here. Their grounds, covered with trees, plants,
fruits and flowers, were then known as the Selva dei
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Rucellai, and must have been of much larger extent
in the time of Machiavelli than they had become
even in the eighteenth century; for when Palla
Rucellai fled in fear of being compromised in the
general hatred of all the Medici followers and
friends, he left the Selva by a little postern door in
its western wall which opened on to the Porta Prato
and the great meadow then surrounding that gateway.
Therefore they must then have covered all the
space now occupied by the detestable modern streets
called Magenta, Solferino, Montebello, Garibaldi,
etc., and I have myself indeed conversed with
persons who remember, in their youth, the orchards
appertaining to these gardens existing where there
are now the ugly boulevards and the dirt and
lumber of the railway and tramway works.</p>

<p class='c001'>On this unfortunate flight of Palla in 1527, the
populace broke into the gardens, and destroyed the
statues, obelisks and temples which ornamented
them, but the woods and orchards they appear to
have spared; for, some thirty years later, the park
seems to have been in its full perfection still, when
Ferdinand, in the height of a violent and devoted
passion, gave it to his Venetian mistress as her <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>casin
de piacere</i></span>, and Bianca brought a mode of life very
unlike that of the grave and scholarly Rucellai into
its classic groves; for although her fate was tragic,
and her mind must have been ever apprehensive of
foul play, she was evidently of a gay, mirthful,
pleasure-loving temperament.</p>

<p class='c001'>The jests and pranks, the sports and pastimes,
the conjuring and comedy, the mirth and music, the
dances and mummeries, which pleased the taste of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Bianca and her women, replaced the ‘noble sessions
of free thought’ and the illustrious fellowship of the
Academicians. The gravity and decorum of the
philosophical society departed, but the floral and
sylvan beauty remained. At the time when she
filled its glades with laughter and song and the
beauty of her women, the Selva was what was even
then called an English garden, with dense woods,
wide lawns, deep shade, and mighty trees which
towered to the skies. But when it passed into the
hands of Giancarlo de’ Medici that Cardinal decorated
it with a grotto, a giant, and other <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>gentilezze</i></span>,
and changed it into an Italian garden, with many
sculptural and architectural wonders, and plants and
flowers from foreign countries, employing in his
designs Antonio Novelli, who, amongst other feats,
brought water to it from the Pitti, and built up an
artificial mountain in its midst. He must have done
much to disfigure it, more than the mob of 1527 had
done; but soon after these ill-considered works were
completed the gardens passed to the Ridolfi, who,
preserving the rare flowers and fruits, with which the
Cardinal had planted it, allowed the woodland growth
to return to its freedom and luxuriance. Of him who
ultimately restricted the park to its present limits, and
robbed the house of all its treasures of art and admirable
ornament, there is, I believe, no record. From
the Ridolfi it went to a family of Ferrara, of the
name of Canonici, and from them to the Stiozzi, who
sold it in our own time to Prince Orloff, by whose
heir it has once more been put up for sale. Amidst
all these changes the beauty of the park, though
impaired, has existed much as it was when it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>celebrated in Latin and Italian prose and verse,
although diminished in size and shorn of its grandeur,
invaded on all sides by bricks and mortar, and cruelly
violated, even in its inmost precincts. The house has
been miserably modernised, and the gardens and
glades miserably lopped, yet still there is much left;
and many of their historic trees still lift their royal
heads to morning dawn and evening stars. Enough
remains to make a green oasis in the desert of modern
bricks and stucco; enough remains for the student
to realise that he stands beneath boughs of cedar
and ilex which once sheltered the august brows of
Leone X. and cast their shade on the gathered
associates of that literary society of which no equal
has ever since been seen. The gardens, even in
their shrunken and contracted space and verdure,
are still there, priceless in memories and invaluable
to the artist, the student and the lover of nature
and of history.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems scarcely credible, yet such is the fact, that
these treasures of natural beauty and storehouses of
historical association should have already once been
invaded to build the ordinary modern house called
Palazzo Sonnino, and that now the municipality is
about to purchase half of them—for what purpose?—<em>to
cut the trees down and cover the ground with
houses for the use of its own office-holders</em>, those
multitudinous and pestilent <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>impiegati</i></span> who are the
curse of the public all over Italy, and feed on it like
leeches upon flesh. That the destruction of such
gardens as these for such a purpose can even be for
an instant spoken of is proof enough of the depths of
degradation to which public indifference and municipal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>vandalism have sunk in the city of Lorenzo. It
can only be equalled by the destruction of the Farnesina
and Ludovisi gardens. Few places on earth
have such intellectual memories as the Oricellari
gardens; yet these are disregarded as nought, and
the cedars and elms which shaded the steps of
philosophers and poets, of scholarly princes and
mighty Popes, are to be felled, as though they were
of no more value than worm-eaten mill-posts.</p>

<p class='c001'>That a people can be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en masse</i></span> so utterly dead to
memory, to greatness, to beauty, and to sense, makes
any serious thinker despair of its future. There are
waste grounds (grounds already deliberately laid
waste) yawning by scores already, in the town and
around it, on which any new buildings which may be
deemed necessary might be raised. There is not one
thread or shadow of excuse for the abominable action
now contemplated by the Florence Municipality, and
certain to be consummated unless some opposition,
strong and resolute, arise. Even were the Orti
Oricellari a mere ordinary park, without tradition,
without heritage, without association, it would be
imbecility to cover the site with bricks and mortar,
for Maxime du Camp has justly written that whoever
fells a tree in a city commits a crime. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Chaque fois
qu’un arbre tombe dans une ville trop peuplée cela
équivaut à un meurtre et parfois à une épidémie. On
a beau multiplier les squares, ils ne remplaceront
jamais la ceinture de forêt qui devrait entourer toute
capitale et lui verser l’oxygène, la force, et la santé.‘</span>
These are words salutary and true, which would be
well inscribed in letters of gold above the council
chamber of every municipality. When towns are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>desperately pinched for space, hemmed in on every
side, and at their wits’ end for lodging-room, there
may be some kind of credible excuse for the always
mistaken destruction of gardens, trees and groves.
But in all the cities of Italy there is no such excuse;
there are vast unoccupied lands all around them; and
in their midst more, many more, houses than are
occupied. In Rome and Florence the latter may be
counted by many thousands. There is not the feeblest,
flimsiest pretext for such execrable destruction as has
already overtaken so many noble gardens in the
former city, and now menaces the Orti Oricellari in
the latter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is this Selva, although the most famous, the
only garden which is being destroyed in Florence,
whilst many beautiful glades and lawns have been, in
the last ten years, ruthlessly ruined and effaced that
the wretched and trumpery structures of the jerry-builders
may arise in their stead. The Riccardi
garden in Valfonda was once like that of the Oricellari,
a marvel of loveliness; and its lawns, its avenues,
its marbles, its deep, impenetrable shades, its sunlit
orange-walks and perfumed pergolate, surrounded a
house which was a temple of art and contained many
choice statues of ancient and contemporary masters.
Talleyrand once said that no one who had not lived
before the great revolution could ever know how
perfect life could be. I would say that none can
know how perfect it can be who did not live in the
Italy of the Renaissance. Take the life of this one
man, Riccardo, Marchese Riccardi, who spent most
of his existence in this exquisite pleasure-place, which
he inherited from its creator, the great scholar and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dilettante</i></span>, Romolo Riccardi, and where he resided
nearly all the year round. In the contemporary
works of Cinelli on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Bellezze di Firenze</i></span>, his house
and gardens are described; they are alluded to by
Redi,—</p>

<p class='c014'>They are spoken of in admiration by Baldinucci, and,
in the description of the festival of Maria de’ Medici’s
marriage by proxy to Henri Quatre, they are enthusiastically
praised by the younger Buonarotti. The
court of the Casino was filled with ancient marbles,
busts, statues and inscriptions, Latin and Greek; the
exterior was decorated in fresco and tempera, with
many rare sculptures and paintings and objects of art,
whilst, without, a number of avenues led in all directions
from the house to the gardens and the woods,
where, in shade of ilex and cypress, marble seats and
marble statues gave a sense of refreshing coolness in
the hottest noon. Here this elegant scholar and
accomplished noble passed almost all his time, receiving
all that was most learned and illustrious in the
society of his epoch; and occasionally giving magnificent
entertainments like that with which he bade
farewell to Maria de’ Medici. Of this delicious retreat
a few trees alone remain now; a few trees, which
raise their sorrowful heads amongst the bricks and
mortar, the theatres and photographic studios, around
them, are all that are left of the once beautiful and
poetic retreat of the scholars and courtiers, the
ambassadors and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>illuminati</i></span>, of the family of the
Riccardi. Why has not such a place as this once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>was been religiously preserved through all time, for
the joy, health and beauty of the city?</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be scarcely possible for so beautiful and
precious a life as this of the Riccardi to be led in our
times, because it is scarcely possible, lock our gates
as we may, to escape from the detestable atmosphere of
excitation and worry which is everywhere around. The
mania of senseless movement is now in the human
race, as the saltatory delirium seized on the Neapolitan
peasants and hurried them in crowds into the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>Riccardo Riccardi living now would be ashamed
to dwell the whole year round in his retreat of Valfonda;
would waste his time over morning newspapers,
cigars and ephemeral telegraphic despatches;
would probably spend his money on horse-racing;
would send his blackletter folios, his first copies, and
his before-letter prints to the hammer, and would
make over his classic marbles to the Louvre, the
Hermitage, or to his own government. He and his
contemporaries had the loveliness of leisure and the
wisdom of meditation; they knew that true culture
is to be gained in the library, not in the rush of a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pérégrinomanie</i></span>; and being great, noble and rich,
judged aright that the best gifts given by high position
and large fortune are the liberty which they
allow for repose, and the power which such repose
confers to enjoy reflection and possession. In
modern life this faculty is almost wholly lost, and the
wit and the fool are shaken together in the vibration of
railway trains, and jostled together in the eating-houses
of the world, till, if the fool thus obtain a varnish of
sharpness, the wit has lost all individuality and grace.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not long since, I said to an Englishman who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>filled high posts and attained high honours, whilst
public life is always repugnant to his tastes and
temperament, that he would have been wiser to have
led his own life in his own way, under his own
ancestral roof-tree in England; and he answered, ‘I
would willingly have done so, but they would have
said that I had nothing in me!’ Characteristic nineteenth
century reply! Romolo and Riccardo Riccardi
did not trouble themselves in their different generations
what their contemporaries thought of them.
They led their own lives in their own leafy solitude,
and only called their world about them when they
were themselves disposed to entertain it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gardens of the Gaddi were equally and still
earlier renowned, and in them the descendants of
Taddeo Gaddi had a pleasure-house wondrous and
lovely to behold, while the rich gallery of pictures
annexed to it was situated next to the Valfonda, and
covered what is now the new Piazza di S. M. Novello.
These descendants had become great people and
eminent in the church, many cardinals and monsignori
amongst them, and also celebrated <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>letterati</i></span>, of whom
Niccolo, son of Senibaldo, was the most illustrious.
He, as well as a scholar and patron of letters and arts,
was, like the Riccardi, a botanist, and, as may be seen
in the pages of Scipione Ammirato, was foremost for
his culture of sweet herbs and of lemons and citrons.
Whilst he filled worthily the post of ambassador and
of collector of works of art for the Medici, he never
forgot his garden and his herb-garden, and was the
first to make general in Tuscany the Judas-tree, the
gooseberry, the strawberry, the Spanish myrtle, the
northern fir and other then rare fruits and shrubs. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>fragrant and so fair were his grounds, that the populace
always called them, and the vicinity perfumed by
them, Il Paradiso dei Gaddi. This beautiful retreat
has for centuries been entirely destroyed and forgotten;
and all which is left of the rich collections of
the Gaddi are those thousand manuscript folios which
Francis I. of Austria purchased and gave to the
libraries of Florence, where to this day they remain
and can be read.</p>

<p class='c001'>The director of the Gaddi gardens bore the delightful
name of Messer Giuseppe Benincasa Fiammingo; and
a contented life indeed this worthy and accomplished
student must have led, working for such a patron, and
passing the peaceful seasons and fruitful years amidst
the cedar-shadows and the lemon-flower fragrance of
this abode of the Muses and of Flora and Pomona.</p>

<p class='c001'>We dwell too much upon the strife and storm, the
bloodshed and the internecine feuds of the passed
centuries; we forget too often the many happy and
useful lives led in them, which were spent untroubled
and consecrated to fair studies and pursuits, and which
let the clangour of battle go by unheard, and mingled
not with camp or court or council.</p>

<p class='c001'>We forget too often the placid life of Gui Patin
under his cherry trees by the river, or of the Etiennes,
in the learned and happy seclusion of their classic
studies and noble work, even their women speaking
Latin as their daily and most natural tongue; we only
have ear for the fusillades of the Fronde, or the war-cries
of Valois and Guise. In like manner we are too
apt only to dwell upon the daggers and poison
powders, the factions and feuds, the conspiracies and
the city riots of the Moyenage and Renaissance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>forget the many quiet, useful, happy persons clad in
doublet and hose, like Messer Benincasa, and the
many learned and noble gentlemen clothed in velvet
and satin, like Niccolo Gaddi, his master, who passed
peacefully from their cradle to their grave.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the fifteenth century, according to Benedetto
Varchi, who himself saw them, there were no less than
a hundred and thirty of these magnificent demesnes in
the city; and whatever may have been the sins of the
earlier and the follies of the later Medici, that family,
one and all, loved flowers, woods and lawns, and
fostered tenderly ‘il gusto del giardinaggio’ in their
contemporaries. This taste in their descendants has
entirely disappeared. They are bored by such of the
magnificent gardens of old as still exist in their towns
and around their villas; they abandon them without regret,
grudging the care of keeping them up, and letting
them out to nursery gardeners or to mere peasants whose
only thought is, of course, to make profit out of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Latins were at all times celebrated for their
beautiful gardens; all classic records and all archæological
discoveries prove it. The Romans and the
Tuscans, the Venetians and the Lombards, in later
mediæval times, inherited this elegant taste, this art,
which is twin child itself with Nature; but in our
immediate epoch it has vanished; the glorious legacies
of it are supported with indifference or done away
with without regret. How is this to be explained? I
know not unless the reason be that there has come
from without a contagion of vulgarity, avarice and
bad taste which the Italian temperament has been
too weak to resist, and with which it has become
saturated and debased. The modern Italian will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>throw money away recklessly on the Bourses or at
the gaming-tables; he will spend it frivolously at
foreign baths and fashionable seaports; he will let
himself be ruined by a pack of idle and good-for-nothing
hangers-on whom he has not the courage to
shake off; but he grudges every penny which is required
for the maintenance of woodland and garden,
and he will allow his trees to be felled, his myrtles,
bays and laurels to vanish, his fountains to be
choked up by sand or weed, and his lawns to degenerate
into rough pasture, without shame or remorse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Almost all these noble gardens enumerated by
Varchi still existed in Florence before 1859. Now
but few remain. Even the Torrigiani gardens (which
for many reasons one would have supposed would
have been kept intact by that family) have been
almost entirely destroyed within the last year, and
the site of them is being rapidly covered with mean
and ugly habitations. The magnificent Capponi
garden, so dear to the blind statesman and scholar,
Gino Capponi, has been more than half broken up
by his heirs. The renowned Serristori garden was
cut in two and shorn of half of its beauty when the
first half of the Via dei Bardi was destroyed. The
Guadagni garden is advertised as building ground.
The Guicciardini gardens are still standing, but as
they and their palace have been given over to amalgamated
railway companies, the respite accorded to
them will probably be of brief duration. The bead
roll of these devastated pleasure-grounds and
historic groves could be continued in an almost
endless succession of names and memories, and the
immensity of their irreparable loss to the city is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>scarcely to be estimated. When we reflect, moreover,
that before 1859 the whole of the ground from
the Carraia Bridge westward was pasture and garden
and avenue, where now there are only bricks and
mortar and a network of ugly streets, we shall more
completely comprehend the senseless folly which built
over such green places, or, where it did not build, made
in their stead such barren, dusty, featureless, blank
spaces as the Piazza degli Zuavi and its congeners.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ubaldino Peruzzi (who has been buried with pomp
in Santa Croce!) was the chief promoter and leader
of this mania of demolition. It was at his instigation
that the Ponte alle Grazie and the chapel of
the Alberti were pulled down; that the Tetto dei
Pisani was destroyed to make way for an ugly
bank; that the noble trees at the end of the
Cascine were felled to make way for a gaudy,
gingerbread bust and a hideous guardhouse; that
the beautiful Stations of the Cross leading to San
Miniato al Monte were destroyed to give place
to vulgar eating-houses and trumpery villas; and
that old palaces, old gardens and old churches were
laid waste to create the bald and monotonous quays
called severally the Lung Arno Serristori and
Torrigiani. Peruzzi began, and for many years
directed, the destruction of the beauties of the city,
and only stopped when, having brought the town to
the verge of bankruptcy, funds failed him, and he
retired perforce from municipal office.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if it may be feared that the good we do does
perish with us, it is certain that the evil we do does
long survive us, and flourishes and multiplies when
we are dust. The lessons which Peruzzi taught his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>fellow-citizens in speculation and spoliation will long
remain, whilst his bones crumble beneath a lying
epitaph. His dead hand still directs the scrambling
haste with which the historic centre of the city is
being torn down, in order that glass galleries, brummagem
shops, miserable statues, and a general reign
of stucco and shoddy, may, as far as in them lies,
bring the Athens of Italy to a level with some third-rate
American township.</p>

<p class='c001'>Except with a few rare exceptions, Italians are
wholly unable to comprehend the indignation with
which their callousness fills the cultured observer of
every other nationality. Anxiety to get ready-money,
an ignorance of their true interests, and a
babyish love of new things, however vulgar or
barbarous, have completely extinguished, in the
aristocracy and bureaucracy, all sentiment for the
arts and all reverence for their inheritance and
for the beauty of Nature. It would seem as if a
kind of paralysis of all perception had fallen on
the whole nation. A prince of great culture, refinement
and reputed taste having occasion this
year to repair his palace, has stuccoed and coloured
it all over a light ochre yellow! A great noble
sold his ancestral gardens last year to a building
company, and his family clapped their hands with
delight as the first ilex trees fell beneath the axe!
To make a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>paven</i></span> street in Venice, unneeded, incongruous,
vulgar, abhorrent to every educated eye and
mind, Byzantine windows, Renaissance doorways,
admirable scrollworks, enchanting façades, marbles,
and mosaics, of hues like the sea-shell and the sea-mouse,
are ruthlessly torn down and pushed out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>sight for ever. Ruskin in vain protests, his tears
scorched up by his rage, and both alike powerless.
Gregorovius died recently, his last years embittered
and tortured by the daily destruction of the Rome
so sublime and sacred to him. I remember well
the day when the axe was first laid to the immemorial
groves of the Farnesina: a barbarous and
venal act, done to gratify private spleen and greed,
leaving a mere mass of mud and dirt where so
late had been the gracious gardens which had seen
Raffaelle and Petrarca pace beneath their shade.
The Spanish Duke, Ripalda, whose passionate love
for his Farnesina was known to all Rome, died of
the sorrow and fever brought on by seeing its desecration,
died actually of a broken heart. ‘I shall not
long survive them,’ he said to me, the tears standing
in his proud eyes, as he looked on the ruin
of his avenues and lawns, which had so late been
the chief beauty of the Tiber, facing their sponsor
and neighbour, the majestic Farnese Palace.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the student, the artist, the archæologist, to live
in Rome now is to suffer inexpressibly every hour, in
mind and heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>Who does not know the piazza of San Giovanni
Laterano as it was? The most exquisite scene of
earth stretched around the most beautiful basilica of
the world! Go there now: the horizon is closed and
the landscape effaced, vile modern erections, crowded,
paltry, monstrous in their impudence and in their degradation,
shut out the green plains, the azure hills,
the divine, ethereal distance, and close around the
spiritual beauty of the great church, like bow-legged
ban-dogs round a stag at bay. The intolerable outrage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of it, the inconceivable shame of it, the crass
obstinacy and stupidity which make such havoc
possible, should fill the dullest soul with indignation.
Yet such things are being done yearly, daily,
hourly, ceaselessly, and with impunity all over
Italy, and no voice is raised in protest. Whenever
any such voice is raised, it is seldom that of
an Italian; it is that of Ruskin, Story, Yriarte,
Taine, Vernon Lee, Augustus Hare, or it is my
own, to the begetting of ten thousand enemies, to
the receiving of twice ten thousand maledictions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is it only in the great cities that such ruin is
wrought. In every little hamlet, on every hill and
plain there is the same process of destruction going
on, which I have before compared to the growth of
lupus on a human face. Rapidly, in every direction,
the beauty, the marvellous, the incomparable,
natural, and architectural beauty of the country is
being destroyed by crass ignorance and still viler
greed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along those famous hillsides, which rise above
Careggi, there was, until a few months ago, a landmark
dear to all the countryside, a line of colossal
cypresses which had been planted there by the hand
of the Pater Patriæ, Cosimo de’ Medici himself.
These grand and noble trees were lately sold, with
the ground on which they stood, to a native doctor of
Florence, who <em>immediately felled them</em>. Yet if before
this unpardonable action, in looking on the fallen
giants, anyone is moved to see the pity of it and
curse the stupid greed which set the axe at their
sacred trunks, he who does so mourn is never the
prince, the noble, the banker, the merchant, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>tradesman; it is some foreign painter or scholar, or
some peasant of the soil who remembers the time
when one vast avenue connected Florence and
Prato.</p>

<p class='c001'>Within one mile of each other there are, near
Florence, a green knoll, crowned with an ancient
church, and a river, shaded by poplar trees; the
beauty of the hill was an historic tower, dating
from the year 1000, massive, mighty, very strong,
having withstood the wars of eight centuries; at
its foot was a stately and aged stone pine. The
beauty of the river was a wide bend, where the
trees and the hills opened out from the water, and
a graceful wooden bridge spanned it, chiefly used
by the millers’ carts and the peasants’ mules. In
the gracious spring-time of last year, the old tower
was pulled down to be used for building materials,
for which it was found that it could not be used,
and the stone pine was felled, because its shade
prevented a few beans to the value of, perhaps, two
francs growing beneath it. On the river the white
wooden bridge has been pulled down, and a huge,
red, brick structure, like a ponderous railway bridge,
hideous, grotesque, and shutting out all the sylvan
view up stream, has been erected in its stead,
altogether unfitted for the slender rural traffic which
alone passes there, and costing a heavy price,
levied by taxation from a rural, and far from rich,
community. Thus are two exquisite landscapes
wantonly ruined; no one who has known those
scenes, as they were a year ago, can endure to look at
them as they are. There was no plea or pretext of
necessity for such a change; the one was due to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>private greed, the other to municipal brutishness and
speculation; some persons are a few pounds the
heavier in purse, the country is for ever so much the
poorer.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, within another mile, an old castellated
villa with two mighty towers, one at either end, and
within it chambers panelled with oak carvings of the
Quattro Cento, of great delicacy and vigour of execution;
it stands amidst a rich champagne country,
abounding in vine and grain and fruits, and bears one
of the greatest names of history. <em>It is now about to
be turned into a candle manufactory!</em> In vain do the
agriculturists around protest that the filthy stench of
the offal which will be brought there, and the noxious
fumes of the smoke, which will pour from the furnace
chimney about to be erected amongst its fir-trees, will
do infinite harm to the vineyards and orchards around.
No one gives ear to their lament. Private cupidity
and communal greed run hand in hand; and the
noble building is doomed beyond hope. Who can
hold their soul in patience or seal their lips to silence
before such impiety and imbecility as this?</p>

<p class='c001'>When this kind of destruction is going on everywhere,
in every city, town, village, province, commune,
all over Italy, who can measure the ultimate effects
upon the face of the country? What, in ten years’
time, will be left of it as Eustace and Stendahl saw
it? What, in twenty years’ time, will be left of it
as we now know it? Every day some architectural
beauty, some noble avenue, some court or loggia or
gateway, some green lawn, or shadowy ilex grove, or
sculptured basin, musical with falling water, and veiled
with moss and maidenhair, is swept away for ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>that some jerry-builder may raise his rotten walls or
some tradesman put up his plate-glass front, or some
dreary desert of rubble and stones delight the eyes
of wise modernity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible to imagine any kind of building
more commonplace, more ugly, and less suitable to
the climate than the modern architecture, or rather
masons’ work, which has become dear to the modern
Italian mind. It is the kind of house which was
built in London twenty or thirty years ago, and now
in London is despised and detested. The fine old
hospital of Santa Lucia, strong as a rock, and sound
as an oak, has recently been knocked down by a
man who, returning with a fortune made in America,
desired to be able to name a street after himself.
(Streets used to be named after heroes who dwelt
in them; they are now named after <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rastaqouères</i></span>, who
pull them down and build them up again.) Instead
of the hospital, there are erected some houses on the
model of London houses of thirty years ago, with
narrow, ignoble windows and façades of the genuine
Bayswater and Westbourne Grove type. There has
not been one opposing voice to their erection, and
any censure of them is immediately answered by a
reference to the brand-new dollars of their builder.
In the suburbs it is the hideous cottage (here called
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>villino</i></span>), which, having disgraced the environs of
London and Paris, is now rapturously set up in the
neighbourhood of Italian towns. Both these types of
house-building (for architecture it is absurd to call it)
are as degraded as they can possibly be; and, whereas
the London and Paris suburban cottages have frequently
the redeeming feature of long windows down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>to the ground, modern Italian houses have narrow
windows of the meanest possible kind, affording no
light in winter and no air in summer. The horrible
English fashion of putting a window on each side of
a narrow doorway is considered beautiful in Italy, and
slavishly followed everywhere, whilst the climbing
roses and evergreen creepers which in England and
France so constantly cover the poorness of modern
houses, are, in Italy, only conspicuous by their absence.
The noble loggias, and balconies, and colonnades of
old Italian mansions were in the old time run over
with the tea rose, the glycine and the banksia; but
the wretched modern Italian ‘villino’ is, in all its
impudence, naked and not ashamed.</p>

<p class='c001'>These dreadful modern constructions, with flimsy
walls, slate roof, pinched doorway, mean windows,
commonness, cheapness and meanness staring from
every brick in their body, are disgracing the approach
of every Italian city; they are met with climbing the
slope of Bellosguardo, beside the hoary walls of Signa,
behind the cypresses of the Poggio Imperiale, on the
road to the Ponte Nomentana, outside the Porta
Salara, on the way to the baths of Caracalla, close
against the walls of the Colosseum, above the green
canal water of Venice, in front of the glad blue sea by
Santa Lucia, anywhere, everywhere, insulting the past,
making hideous the present, suited to no season and
absurd in every climate, the rickety offspring of a
century incapable of artistic procreation.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible to enter into the minds of men who
actually consider it a finer thing, a prouder thing, to
be a third-rate, mediocre, commercial city than to be
the first artistic, or the noblest historic, city of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>world. Yet this is what the modern Italian, the
Italian who governs in ministry, bureaucracy, municipality,
and press, deliberately does prefer. He thinks
it more glorious, and worthier, to be a feeble imitation
of a shoddy American city than to be supreme in
historic, artistic and natural beauty. He will sell his
Tiziano, his Donatello, his Greek and Roman marbles,
and his Renaissance tapestries without shame; and
he will pant and puff with pride because he has
secured a dirty tramway coaling-yard, has befouled
his atmosphere with mephitic vapours and coal-tar
gas, and has reduced his lovely <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>verzaja</i></span>, so late
green with glancing foliage and fresh with rippling
water, into a howling desert of iron rails, shot rubbish,
bricks and mortar, unsightly sheds, and smoke-belching
chimneys. To the educated observer the choice is
as piteous and as grotesque as that of the South Sea
Islander greedily exchanging his pure, pear-shaped,
virgin pearl for the glass and pinchbeck of a Birmingham
brooch.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not many years ago there was in these gardens of
the Oricellari of which I have spoken a neglected
statue lying unnoticed in a darksome place. It was
the Cupid of Michaelangelo, which, being discovered
by the sculptor Santerelli, there and then was sold to
the South Kensington Museum, where it may be seen
to-day. This will ere long be the fate of all the
sculptures and statues of Italy, and the ‘modern
spirit’ now prevailing in the country will consider it
best that it should be so.</p>

<p class='c001'>The empty word of ‘progress’ which is repeated by
all nations in this day, as if they were parrots, and
has as much meaning in it as if it were only ‘poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>poll,’ is continually used to cover, or feign to excuse,
all these barbarous enormities; but most insincerely,
most vainly. To turn a rich agricultural country
into a fourth-rate manufacturing one can claim neither
sagacity nor prudence as its defence. To demolish
noble, ancient and beautiful things, in order to reproduce
the modern mushroom-growths of a dreary and
dusty ‘western township,’ can allege neither sense nor
shrewdness as its excuse; it is simply extremely silly;
even if inspired by greed it is both silly and short-sighted.
Yet it is the only thing which the Italian
municipal councils consider it excellent to do; they
have, after their manner, sufficiently paid tribute to
the arts when they have chipped a Luca Della Robbia
medallion out of an ancient wall and put it away in a
glass case in some gallery, or when they have taken
an altar (as they have just taken the silver altar out
of San Giovanni) and locked it up in some museum
where nobody goes.<a id='rE' /><a href='#fE' class='c015'><sup>[E]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To the arguments of common sense that an altar is
as safe, and as visible, in the baptistery as in a
museum, and that five centuries have passed over
Luca’s out-of-door work without wind or weather,
heat or frost, impairing it in the least, no one in the
municipal council of any town would for a moment
attend. They do not want reason or fitness; they
only want the vaporous, fussy, greedy, braggart
‘modern tone.’</p>

<p class='c001'>Everyone who has visited Florence knows the
house fronting the gate of San Pier Gattolino (Porta
Romana), on the front of which are found remnants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of an almost wholly damaged fresco, through which
a window has been cut. The house was once radiant
with the frescoes of Giovanni di San Giovanni, which
Cosimo dé Medici caused to be painted on its façade,
because fronting the gateway by which all travellers
came from Rome, ‘it was to be desired, for the honour
of the city, that the first impression of all such travellers
should be one of joy and beauty, to the end
that such strangers might receive pleasure therein and
tarry willingly.’ This wise and hospitable reasoning
has been utterly lost sight of by those who rule our
modern cities, and the approaches to all of them are
defiled and disfigured, so that the heart of the
traveller sinks within his breast. Instead of Cosimo’s
gay and gracious fresco-pageantry upon the walls,
there are only now, by the Romano gate, a steam
tramway belching filthy smoke, a string of carts
waiting to be taxed, and a masons’ scaffolding where
lately towered the Torrigiani trees!</p>

<p class='c001'>Reflect for a moment what the rule of—we will not
say an Augustus, but merely of a Magnifico, of a
Francois Premier—might have made in these thirty
years of modern Italy. Marvellous beauty, incomparable
grandeur of form, surpassing loveliness of
Nature, entire sympathy of the cultured world and
splendour immeasurable of tradition and example,
all these after the peace of Villafranca, as after
the breach of Porta Pia, lay ready to the hand of
any ruler of the land who could have comprehended
their meaning and their magnificence, their assured
opportunity and their offered harmony.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there was no one; and the moment has long
passed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>The country has been guided instead into the
trumpery and ephemeral triumphs of what is called
modern civilisation, and an endless expenditure has
gone hand in hand with a mistaken policy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whenever a royal visit is made to any Italian town,
the preparations for it invariably include some frightful
act of demolition, as when at Bologna, on the
occasion of the late state visit of the sovereigns, the
noble Communal Palace of that city was bedaubed
all over with a light colouring, and its exquisitely
picturesque and irregular casements were altered,
enlarged, and cut about into the mathematical
monotony dear to the municipal mind, no one present
having sense to see that all the harmony and dignity
of its architecture were ruthlessly obliterated. Some
similar action is considered necessary in every town,
big or little, before the reception of any prince, native
or foreign. The results are easily conceived. It is
said that William of Germany did not conceal his
ridicule of the colossal equestrian statues in <em>pasteboard</em>
which were set up in the station entrance at Rome in
his honour; but as a rule the royal persons in Europe
appear not to have any artistic feeling to offend. The
only two who had any were hurled in their youth, by
a tragic fate, out of a world with which they had little
affinity. Those who remain have no sympathy for
tradition or for the arts. The abominations done
daily in their names and before their eyes leave them
wholly unmoved. Nay, it is no secret that they do
constantly approve and urge on the vandalism of
their epoch.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Italian people would have been easily led into
a higher and wiser form of life. (I speak of the Italian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>people as distinguished from the Italian bureaucracy
and borghesia, which are both of a crass and hopeless
philistinism.) The country people especially have an
artistic sense still latent in them, and they remain
often artistic in their attire, despite the debasing
temptations of cheap and vulgar modern clothing.
Their ear for music is generally perfect, they detect
instantly the false note or the faulty chord which
many an educated hearer might let pass unnoticed.
Their national songs, serenades, and poems are
admirable in purity and grace, and although now,
alas! comparatively rarely heard on hillside and by
seashore, they remain essentially the verse of the
people. Unfortunately this part of the nation is
absolutely unrepresented. The noisy agitator, the
greedy office-seeker, the unscrupulous politician, the
pert, unhealthy lawyer crowd to the front and screech
and roar until they are esteemed both at home and
abroad to be the sole and indivisible ‘public,’ whilst
their influence, by intrigue and bustle, does most
unhappily predominate in all spheres municipal and
political; and the entire press, subsidised by them,
justifies them in all they do and pushes their selfish
and soulless speculations down the throats of unwilling
and helpless men.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘Mi son meco,’</span> says Benedetto Varchi, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘molte volte
stranamente maravigliato com’ esser posso che in

<p class='c001'>A people of whom this was essentially, and not
merely rhetorically, true, would have been with little
difficulty kept within the fair realm of art and guided
to a fine ideal, in lieu of being given for their guides
the purchased quill-men of a venal journalism, and
bidden to worship a dirty traction-engine, a plate-glass
shop front, and a bridge of cast-iron, painted
red.</p>

<p class='c001'>If through the last thirty years a sovereign with the
cultured tastes of a Leonello d’Este or a Lorenzo del
Moro, had been dominant in the councils of Italy, he
would have made his influence and his desires so felt
that the municipalities and ministries would not have
dared to commit the atrocities they have done. Constitutional
monarchs may be powerless in politics, but
in art and taste their power for good and for evil is
vast. Alas! in no country in Europe is any one of
them a scholar or a <a id='corr185.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='connossieur'>connoisseur</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_185.22'><ins class='correction' title='connossieur'>connoisseur</ins></a></span>. They have no
knowledge of the one field in which alone their
influence would be unhampered, and might be
salutary. They think themselves forced to pat and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>praise the modern playthings of war and science, and
of beauty they have no conception, of antiquity they
have merely jealousy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be deplored, not only as a national, but
as a world-wide, loss that Modern Italy has entirely
missed and misconceived the way to true greatness
and to true prosperity. In other centuries she was
the light of the world; in this she deliberately prefers
to be the valet of Germany and the ape of America.
Had there been men capable of comprehending her
true way to a new life, and capable of leading her
varied populations in that way, she might have seen
a true and a second Renaissance. But those men
are not existing, have not existed, within recent times
for her; her chiefs have all been men who, on the
contrary, knew nothing of art and cared nothing for
nature; a statesman like Cavour, a conspirator like
Mazzini, a free-lance like Garibaldi, a soldier like
Victor Emmanuel were none of them men to understand,
much less to re-create, the true genius of the
nation; their eyes were fixed on political troubles,
on social questions, on acquisition of territory, on
quarrels with the Pope, and alliances with reigning
houses. Since their death lesser people have taken
their places, but have all followed in the same tracks,
have all misled the nation to imagine that her
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>risorgimento</i></span> lies in copying American steam-engines
and keeping ironclads ready for a signal from the
potentate of Berlin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Italy might be now, as she was in the past, the
Muse, the Grace, the Artemis and the Athene of the
world; she thinks it a more glorious thing to be only
one amongst a sweating mob of mill-hands.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Italy, beautiful, classic, peaceful, wise with the
wisdom inherited from her fathers, would have been
the garden of the world, the sanctuary of pure art and
of high thought, the singer of immortal song. Instead,
she has deliberately chosen to be the mere
imitator of a coarse and noisy crowd on the other
side of the Atlantic, and the mere echo of the armed
bully who dictates to her from the banks of the
Spree.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>If there were any free speech or free action in
matters political permitted in what is known as
Free Italy, it would be at once interesting and useful
to ask of its Government under what <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span> they
govern? Is it under a constitutional monarchy, a
dictatorship, a military despotism, or what? The
reply would probably be that it is still a constitutional
monarchy with popular parliamentary representation.
But the counter reply would be: Then why are all
the restraints limiting a constitutional sovereign
broken through and all the privileges appertaining to,
and creating the purpose of, parliamentary representation
violated or ignored? When the king of a constitutional
Italy violated the Constitution in refusing
the Zanardelli Cabinet because it did not promise
acquiescence in his own views, the country should
have protested, and insisted on the Zanardelli Cabinet
being placed in power for the sake of the constitutional
principle therein involved. It was the first
step towards absolutism. If it had been promptly
stopped and punished there would have been no more
similar steps. It was allowed to pass unchastised,
and the result has been that every succeeding week
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>which has since passed has seen worse and continual
violations of the Constitution and the Code.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘<i>L’uomo fatale</i>,’ as the Italian people call Crispi,
was summoned to rule, and the result has been, what
everyone cognisant of his character knew would be
inevitable, namely, the abolition of all liberties and
safeguards of the body politic, and the substitution of
secret, irresponsible, and absolutely despotic, tribunals,
and secret agencies, worked by the will of one man.
The revolutionary movement has been crushed by
military force with a brutality and injustice which,
were the scene Russia or Austria, would cause
monster meetings of indignation in London. Led
by <cite>The Times</cite>, <cite>The Post</cite>, and other journals, English
opinion is deaf and blind to the tyrannies which
it would be the first to denounce in any other
nation. English opinion does not choose to understand,
and does not desire to be forced to understand,
that Italy is at the present time as completely
ruled by an unscrupulous despotism, and by
sheer use of the sabre and musket, as is Poland at
this hour, or as Austrian Venetia was earlier in the
century; and that Italy presents the same spectacle
of prisoners, purely political, being hustled through
the towns manacled by handcuffs and chained to one
another by a long iron fetter; lawyers, landowners,
merchants, editors, men of education, probity and
honourable life being yoked with the common criminal
and the hired bravo. It is difficult to comprehend
how and why this shameful outrage upon decency
and liberty is viewed with indifference by the rest of
Europe. That it may give pleasure to the foes of
Italy is easily understood; but how can it fail to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>give pain and alarm to her friends? How is it that
unanimous protest and unanimous censure do not
arise from all those who profess to recognise the
necessity of freedom for national well-being?</p>

<p class='c001'>The extreme gravity of the fact that the Italian
sovereign chooses and caresses a minister who is
permitted to set aside at will all ordinary provisions
and protections of the law, does not appear to excite
any astonishment or apprehension outside Italy. In
Italy itself the people are paralysed with fear; the
steel is at their throats, and the army, which they
have been ruined to construct and maintain, crushes
them into silence and exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the English people picture to themselves what
would have been the verdict of Europe if England
had dealt with Ireland as Sicily has been dealt with;
let them imagine Lord Wolseley acting like General
Morra; let them imagine a cordon drawn around the
whole island, ingress and egress forbidden under pain
of arrest, telegrams destroyed, approaching vessels
fired upon, the whole population forcibly disarmed,
no news—save such as might be garbled by superior
order—permitted to be despatched from the interior
to the world at large, thousands of men thrust into
prison on suspicion whilst their families starved,
absolute secrecy, absolute darkness and mystery
covering irresponsible despotism; let the English
public imagine such a state as this in Ireland, and
then ask themselves what would be the verdict of
Europe and America upon it. Sicily contains two
millions of persons, and this vast number has been
given over to the <a id='corr190.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='absoulte'>absolute</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_190.32'><ins class='correction' title='absoulte'>absolute</ins></a></span> will of a single brutal
soldier, who is screened by ministerial protection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>from any ray of that daylight of publicity which is
the only guarantee for the equity of public men.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are told that the island is pacified. So is a
garotted and blindfolded creature pacified; so is a
murdered corpse pacified. The most merciless reprisals
have followed on the attempts of the peasantry
to save themselves from the grinding extortions
of their usurers and the pitiless taxation of their
communes; and the reign of terror which has been
established is called tranquillity. The same boast
of ‘peace when there is no peace’ is made in the
Lunigiana.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is not even the gloss of affected legality in
the countless arrests which have filled to overflowing
the prisons of Italy. The charges by which these
arrests are excused are so wide that they are a net
into which all fish, big and little, may be swept. The
imputation of ‘inciting to hatred between the classes’
is so vague that it may include almost any expression
of social or political opinion. It is an accusation
under which almost every great writer, thinker or
philosopher would be liable to arrest, and under which
Jesus Christ and Jean Jacques Rousseau, Garibaldi
and John Milton, Washington and Brahma, <a id='corr191.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Tolstoi'>Tolstoï</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_191.23'><ins class='correction' title='Tolstoi'>Tolstoï</ins></a></span>
and St Paul would be all alike condemned as
criminals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Equally vague is the companion accusation of inciting
to civil war. As I pointed out in my article of
last month, Italy owes her present existence entirely
to civil war. Civil war may be a dread calamity, but
it may be also an heroic remedy for ills far greater
than itself. What is called authority in Italy is so
corrupt in itself that it cannot command the respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of men, and has no title to demand their obedience.
The creator itself of civil war and disturbance, such
authority becomes ridiculous when draping itself in
the toga of an intangible dignity. Moreover, it is
now incarnated in the person of a single unscrupulous
opportunist. Why should the nation respect either
his name or his measures? The King of Italy, always
servilely copying Germany, has decreed the name and
measures of the lawyer Crispi sacred, as Germany
has sent to prison many writers and printers for having
expressed opinions hostile to the acts or speeches
of German public men. Under the state called <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>piccolo
stato d’assedio</i></span> military tribunals judge civil offences,
or what are considered offences, and pass sentences of
imprisonment varying in duration from six months to
thirty years. The infamous sentence of twenty-three
years’ imprisonment, of which three are to be passed
in solitary confinement, passed on the young advocate
Molinari, for what is really no more than an offence
of opinions, has forced a cry of surprise and disgust
even from the German press. The monstrous iniquity
of this condemnation has made even the blind and
timid worm of Italian public feeling turn writhing
under the iron heel which is crushing it, and this
individual sentence is to be carried for appeal into
the civil courts, where it is fervently to be hoped it
may be altered if not cancelled.<a id='rG' /><a href='#fG' class='c015'><sup>[G]</sup></a> Hundreds of
brutal sentences have been passed for which there is
no hope or chance of appeal, and vast numbers of
men, in the flower of youth or the prime of manhood,
are being flung into the hell of Italian prisons, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>to be left to rot away in unseen and unpitied suffering,
till death releases them or insanity seizes them.
Insanity comes quickly in such torture as Italian
prison-life is to its victims.</p>

<p class='c001'>A journal called <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>L’Italia del Popolo</cite></span> contained a
spirited and eloquent article proving that Crispi was
neither courageous nor honest, as a Socialist deputy
had in a moment of flattery called him: this perfectly
legitimate and temperate article caused the confiscation
of the paper! ‘If Crispi be Almighty God, let
us know it!’ said the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Secolo</i></span> of Milan, a courageous
and well-written daily newspaper which has itself been
frequently confiscated for telling the truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>As specimens of other sentences passed in the

following examples:</p>

<p class='c001'>In Siena the proprietor of the journal <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Martinello

<p class='c001'>The journal <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Italia del Popolo</cite></span> was seized because
it contained quotations from the Memoirs of Kossuth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Secolo</i></span> of Milan was seized for protesting
against the condemnation to <i>twenty years’</i> imprisonment
of the soldier Lombardino, although he had
completely proved his innocence of the offence
attributed to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The barber, Vittorio Catani, having been heard, in
the Piazza S. Spirito of Florence, to say that the
revolts in Sicily were due to hunger and distress, was
condemned to three months’ imprisonment and fifty

also, were sentenced to a year and a half of prison
because an old rusty gun, quite useless, was found in
a cupboard, although there was no evidence whatever
that they owned, or knew of its existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are a few typical instances of sentences
passed by the hundred, and tens of hundreds, at
the present hour in the unhappy kingdom of Italy.
Everyone suspected however slightly, accused however
indirectly, is arrested and removed from sight.
Oftentimes, as in Molinari’s case, the sentence embraces
periods of solitary confinement, that infernal
mental torture under which the strongest intellect
gives way. What is the rest of Europe about that it
views unmoved such suffering and such tyranny as
this? Let it be remembered that the vast majority
of these prisoners have no crime at all on their consciences.
Molinari, sentenced in his youth to twenty-three
years of prison, has committed no sin except
that of being a Socialist. The term Anarchist is
constantly used by the tribunals to describe men who
are merely guilty of such opinions as are held by
your Fabian Society in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>There has been no actual <i>coup d’état</i>, but there has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>been what is worse, because less tangible, than a <i>coup
d’état</i>, namely, the insidious and secretive alteration of
a constitutional Government into a despotic one, the
unauthorised and illegitimate suppression of free
discussion and of lawful measures, and the substitution
for them of arbitrary methods and secret-police
investigation. The change has been quite as great
as that which was wrought in Paris by the canon of
the Tenth of December, but it has been made by
means more criminal, because less open and as yet
unavowed. The King of Italy, having mounted the
throne under an engagement to hold inviolate the
Constitution, has violated it as violently as Louis
Napoleon his oath to the French Republic; but he
has done so more insidiously and less courageously,
having never dared to announce to his people his
intention to do so. His decree postponing the
assembling of the Chambers because ‘public discussion
would be prejudicial’ was a virtual declaration
that parliamentary government was at an end, but
the fact was covered by an euphemism. In like
manner, Crispi has said that he will ‘ask’ for irresponsible
powers to be given him, but he defers the
day of asking, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad interim</i></span> takes those powers
and uses them as he chooses. The Italian Chambers
are to be allowed to meet, but it is intimated to
them that unless they vote for the ‘full powers’
they will be dissolved, and a more obedient Parliament
elected under the military law of the existing
reign of terror. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘La camera sapra quelle che
si deve sapere,’</span> Crispi stated the other day; that
is, he will tell them as much as he chooses them
to know. The amount of the financial deficit is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>to be put before the Chambers as one half only of
what it really is. If there be any exposure made, or
hostility shown, he has his weapon ready to his hand
in dissolution. A new chamber elected under his
docile prefects and his serried bayonets will not fail
to be the humble spaniel he requires. If the present
deputies, when the decree proroguing their assembly
was proclaimed, had all met in Rome, and, without
distinction of party or group, had insisted on the
opening of Parliament, and compelled the monarch to
keep his engagement to the Constitution, it is possible
that both he and his minister would have submitted.
But Italian deputies are poor creatures, and
the few men of mark and strength who are amongst
them are swamped under the weight of the invertebrate
numbers. Hence we are scandalised by the
spectacle of a whole body of the elected representatives
of a nation being muzzled and set aside, and
their discussion of opinion and action declared prejudicial
to the interests of their country. It would be
simpler and more candid to sweep away Parliament
and Senate altogether than to make of them a mere
mechanical dummy, pushed aside as useless lumber
whenever there is any agitation or danger before
their country. Umberto of Savoia would hesitate to
proclaim himself an absolute sovereign, but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de facto</i></span>,
though not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de jure</i></span>, he has made himself one. The
text of the Treaty of the Triplice has never been
made known to the country. Rumours have been
heard that there are private riders attached to it
which personally bind the House of Savoy to the
House of Hohenzollern, and cause the otherwise inexplicable,
and in every event culpable, obstinacy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the Italian sovereign in insisting on the inviolability
of the military <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cadres</i></span>. Be this as it may, the engagements
of the treaty are kept a profound secret, and
such secrecy is probably one of the clauses. Now, if
the will and signature of one man suffice to pledge a
nation in the dark to the most perilous obligations
none can predict the issue, what is this except an
absolute monarchy? What pretence can there still
be of a constitutional Government?</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the English nation figure to itself their Queen
binding them secretly to the most onerous engagements
which might cause in the end the total exhaustion
and even extinction of their country, and they
will then comprehend what Italians are enduring, and
have long endured, from the secret pact of their
sovereign, of which they have no means to measure
the dangers or the responsibilities, although the
burden and terror of these lie upon them. It is only
by means of the military gag that the sovereign can
keep mute the popular anxiety, curiosity and alarm.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only reforms which would be of the slightest
practical use would be the abolition of the hated gate-tax,
and salt-tax,<a id='rH' /><a href='#fH' class='c015'><sup>[H]</sup></a> and the reduction of the military
and naval expenditure. There is no ministry of any
party who dares propose these, the only possible,
alleviations of the national suffering.</p>

<p class='c001'>The formation of the Kingdom of Italy has been
aggrandisement, gain and rejoicing to the Piedmontese
and Lombard States, but it has been only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>oppression, loss and pain to the country south of the
Appenines. Even in the Veneto, if the gauge of
felicity be prosperity, the province must miserably
regret the issue of its longed-for liberation. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘Piû
gran’ miseria non c’è sulla terra che n’ l’è la nostra,’</span>
says a gondolier of Venice to me in this ninety-fourth
year of the century. The magnificent and hardy
race of gondoliers is slowly and wretchedly perishing,
under the grinding wheels of communal extortion,
and the ignoble rivalry of the dirty steamboats and
the electric launches. But there is greater misery still
than theirs, such misery as makes the worst hell of
Dante’s heaven by comparison—the misery of the
children in Sicily, little white slaves sold for a
hundred, or a hundred and fifty francs each, to
brutal blows, smarting wounds, incessant labour,
and absolutely hopeless bondage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Court-martial is substituted for civil law at the mere
will of the monarch and his minister. There has
been nothing in the recent events which can justify
the establishment of it, and its abominable and irresponsible
decrees, in which the torture of solitary confinement
so largely figures. Local dissensions and
jealousies find vent in accusations and condemnations,
and the barbarity of the soldier and the gendarme to
the civilian is regarded as a virtue and rewarded.
What can be said of a Government which confounds
the political writer with the brigand of the hills, the
peaceful doctrinaire with the savage assassin, the
harmless peasant with the poisoner or strangler, and
chains them all together, and pushes them all together
into prison-cells, fœtid, pestilent, wretched, already
overcrowded? What will be done with all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>thousands? What will be made of all this loss and
waste of life? Miserable as is the existence of Italian
felons, they must eat something, however scanty. The
cost to the country of their useless, stagnant, fettered
lives will be immense, whilst their own anguish will
be unspeakable. Many of them, I repeat, are guilty
of no offence whatever except of desiring a republic,
or professing Socialist doctrines. I have no personal
leaning towards Socialism, and regard it as
unworkable, and believe that it would be pernicious
if it could be brought to realisation. But it is no
crime to be a Socialist. Socialism is an opinion, a
doctrine, a creed, an idea; and those who hold it have
every right to make a propaganda when they can. It
is monstrous that, at the pleasure of a monarch or a
minister, an idea can be treated as a capital crime.
The young advocate Molinari is guilty of nothing
except of inculcating revolutionary doctrines. What
sin is this? It is one shared by Gautama and Christ.</p>

<p class='c001'>Maxime du Camp has just died, a member of the
Academy of France. He was once one of the Thousand
of Marsala. What is now bringing intellectual
and gifted youths to the felon’s dock in Italy is precisely
such a creed as drove the late Academician
to enrol himself under Garibaldi. Who shall affirm
that there may not be in these young men, thus infamously
judged and sentenced to-day, such brilliant
intelligence and critical acumen as have made Maxime
du Camp the admired of all who can appreciate
scholarship, style, perception and true philanthropy,
whether they may or may not agree with his arguments
or endorse his deductions?</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be impossible for any generous or unselfish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>nature not to burn with indignation before the poverty
entailed on Italy by military madness, and the suffering
caused to the poor and harmless by the fiscal and
municipal tyrannies and the hired spies and extortioners
of the Government.<a id='rI' /><a href='#fI' class='c015'><sup>[I]</sup></a> Jules Simon said the
other day that pity is the mark of great souls. In
Italy it is considered the mark of the malefactor. A
young nobleman of the Lunigiana, Count Lazzoni,
has now a price set upon his head because he has
espoused and taught the doctrines of Mazzini. He
was rich, gifted, fortunate; his family insisted that he
should give up either his doctrines or themselves, and,
with themselves, his estates and title. He chose to
abandon the last, not without great personal affliction,
because he was tenderly attached to his relatives.
This young hero is now being hunted by soldiery,
and when found will be tried by court-martial under
the convenient charge of ‘exciting to class-hatreds.’
Yet what are such young men as these but the very
salt and savour of a country? It is not they who are
the criminals, but the egotists who dance and dine,
and gamble and smoke, and bow at the Quirinale, and
the Vatican, and pay court to the favourites of the
hour, and care nothing what ruin hangs over their
country, nor what suffering is entailed on their countrymen,
so long as they get a rosette for their buttonhole,
or rear the favourite for a race in their stables. They
are the true criminals; not the youths, like Molinari
and Lazzoni, not the men like De Felice and Barbato,
who think and feel and dare.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why are not the young Princes of the House of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Savoy amongst the suffering peasantry of Sicily, seeing
with their own eyes, hearing with their own ears, doing
something to aid, to mitigate, to console, instead of
spending their lives in leading cotillons, driving
tandem, trying on new uniforms, and shooting in all
seasons of the year? Why do they not go and live
for a month in the sulphur-mines, carry the creels of
sulphur on their bare backs, and feel the stinging
smart of it in their blinded eyes and dried-up throats
and excoriated lips? They would then, at least, know
something of how a portion of their people live and
die. It would be more useful than dressing up in
plumes and armour to amuse William of Prussia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lockroy, in writing to the French newspaper
<i>L’Eclair</i>, says that Italy is served well by her public
servants, and possesses unlimited resources and marvellous
genius. In what way is she well served by
her public servants? She is stripped bare by all who
pretend to serve her, and everyone who enters her
service, high and low, seeks only to advantage and
enrich himself. Corruption, like dry-rot in a tree, permeates
the whole public organisation of Italy, from the
highest to the lowest official. All the municipalities
are rotten and rapacious. Nothing is done without
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>mancia</i></span>; or, as it is called further East, <em>backsheesh</em>.
The law courts are swarming hotbeds of bribery and
perjury.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her natural resources may be great, but they are
so burdened by impost and tax, so strained, fettered,
prematurely harvested and spent, that they are exhausted
ere they are ripe. Of her genius there is
but little fruit in these days; there is no originality
in modern Italian talent; in art, literature, science,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>architecture, all is imitation, and imitation of an
ignoble model; the national sense of beauty, once so
universal, so intense, is dead; the national grace and
gaiety are dying; the accursed, withering, dwarfing,
deforming spirit of modernity has passed like a blast
over the country and made it barren.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the people there are still beauty of form and
attitude, charm and elegance of manner, infinite
patience, infinite forbearance, infinite potentialities
of excellence as of evil. But they need a saviour,
a guide, a friend; they need a Marcus Aurelius,
a Nizahualcoytl, a St Louis, a Duke Frederic of
Montefeltro, a ruler who would love them, who
would raise them, who would give them food bodily
and mental, and lead them in the paths of peace and
loveliness. Instead of such, what have they? Men
who set their wretched ambition on the approving
nod of a Margrave of Brandenburg; who deem it
greatness to turn a whole starving peasantry into a
vast ill-ordered, ill-equipped, and ill-fed army; who,
for pomp, parade, and windy boast seize the last coin,
the last crust, the last shirt; who find a paltry ideal
in an American machine-room, an elevated railway,
and an electric gun; and who deem an ignoble vassalage
to the German Emperor meet honour and
glory for that Italy which was empress of the earth
and goddess of the arts when the German was a
forest-brute, a hairy boor, a scarce human Caliban of
northern lands.</p>

<p class='c001'>As events have moved within the last few weeks it
is wholly within the bonds of possibility, even of
probability, that if the Crown and its chief counsellor
see greater danger to themselves threaten them in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>coming year, they may appeal for armed help to their
ally, who is almost their suzerain, and a fence of
Prussian bayonets may be placed around the Quirinale
and the House of Assembly. Who shall say that the
secret and personal treaty does not provide for such
protection?</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as a public opinion can be said to exist in
Italy (for in a French or English sense of the words it
does not as yet exist), it is stirring to deep uneasiness
and indignation at the subserviency of the tribunals to
the ferocity of the Government in what is compared
to the Bloody Assize of the English Jeffreys. It is
becoming every day more and more alarmed at the
absolutism of a King, all criticism of whose acts is
made penal, yet whose personal interference and
obstruction is every day becoming more obvious,
more galling, and more mischievous. A new place of
deportation for the condemned of Massa-Carrara is
being prepared on the pestilential shore of the
Southern Maremma. This new <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ergastolo</i></span> may prove
not only a tomb for those confined in it; but it may
very possibly become a pit in which the Italian
monarchy will be buried. If the next election should
return, as it may do, two hundred of the Extreme
Left, ‘<i>l’uomo fatale</i>’ may be the cause of a revolution
as terrible as that of 1789.</p>

<p class='c001'>Foreign speakers and writers of the present hour
predict the success of Crispi. What is meant by
the word? What success is there possible? The enforced
acceptance of additional taxation? The placing
of the last straw which breaks the camel’s back?
The quietude which in the body politic, as in the
physical body, follows on drainage of the blood and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>frequently presages the faintness of death? The
reduction of parliamentary representation to a mere
comedy and formula? The passive endurance of
martial tyranny by a frightened nation, whose terror
is passed off as acquiescence? The increase of debt,
the enlargement of prisons, the paralysis of the public
press?</p>

<p class='c001'>These are the only things which can be meant by
the success of Francesco Crispi, or can be embodied
in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is the brummagen Sylla of an age of sham, but
he has all the desire of Sylla to slay his enemies and
to rule alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this sense, but only in this sense, he may succeed.
Around the sham Sylla, as around the real Sylla,
there may be laid waste a desolated and silent country,
in which widows will mourn their dead, and fatherless
children weep for hunger under burning roofs. Such
triumph as this he may obtain. Italy has seen many
triumph thus, and has paid for their triumph with her
tears and with her blood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>THE NEW WOMAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>It can scarcely be disputed, I think, that in the
English language there are conspicuous at the
present moment two words which designate two unmitigated
bores: The Workingman and the Woman.
The Workingman and the Woman, the New Woman,
be it remembered, meet us at every page of literature
written in the English tongue; and each is convinced
that on its own special W hangs the future of the
world. Both he and she want to have their values
artificially raised and rated, and a status given to
them by favour in lieu of desert. In an age in which
persistent clamour is generally crowned by success
they have both obtained considerable attention; is it
offensive to say much more of it than either deserves?</p>

<p class='c001'>A writer, signing the name of Sarah Grand, has of
late written on this theme; and she avers that the
Cow-Woman and the Scum-Woman, man understands;
but that the New Woman is above him. The elegance
of these choice appellatives is not calculated to recommend
them to educated readers of either sex; and
as a specimen of style forces one to hint that the New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Woman who, we are told, ‘has been sitting apart
in silent contemplation all these years’ might in all
these years have studied better models of literary
composition.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are farther on told ‘that the dimmest perception
that you may be mistaken, will save you from
making an ass of yourself.’ It appears that even
this dimmest perception has never dawned upon the
New Woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are farther told that ‘thinking and thinking,’
in her solitary, sphinx-like contemplation, she solved
the problem and prescribed the remedy (the remedy
to a problem!); but what this remedy was we are
not told, nor did the New Woman apparently disclose
it to the rest of womankind, since she still hears them
in ‘sudden and violent upheaval’ like ‘children unable
to articulate whimpering for they know not what.’
It is sad to reflect that they might have been ‘easily
satisfied at that time’ (at what time?), ‘but society
stormed at them until what was a little wail became
convulsive shrieks;’ and we are not told why the
New Woman who had ‘the remedy for the problem,’
did not immediately produce this remedy. We are
not told either in what country or at what epoch this
startling upheaval of volcanic womanhood took place
in which ‘man merely made himself a nuisance with
his opinions and advice,’ but apparently did quell
this wailing and gnashing of teeth since it would
seem that he has managed still to remain more
masterful than he ought to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are further informed that women ‘have allowed
him to arrange the whole social system, and manage,
or mismanage, it all these ages without ever seriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>examining his work with a view to considering
whether his abilities and his methods were sufficiently
good to qualify him for the task.’</p>

<p class='c001'>There is something comical in the idea thus suggested,
that man has only been allowed to ‘manage
or mismanage’ the world because woman has graciously
refrained from preventing his doing so. But
the comic side of this pompous and solemn assertion
does not for a moment offer itself to the New Woman
sitting aloof and aloft in her solitary meditation on
the superiority of her sex. For the New Woman
there is no such thing as a joke. She has listened
without a smile to her enemy’s ‘preachments’; she
has ‘endured poignant misery for his sins;’ she has
‘meekly bowed her head’ when he called her bad
names; and she has never asked for ‘any proof of
the superiority’ which could alone have given him
a right to use such naughty expressions. The truth
about everything has all along been in the possession
of woman; but strange and sad perversity of taste!
she has ‘cared more for man than for truth, and so
the whole human race has suffered!’</p>

<p class='c001'>‘All that is over, however,’ we are told, and ‘while
on the one hand man has shrunk to his true proportions’
she has, during the time of this shrinkage,
been herself expanding, and has in a word come to
‘fancy herself’ extremely, so that he has no longer
the slightest chance of imposing upon her by his
game-cock airs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man, ‘having no conception of himself as imperfect’
(what would Hamlet say to this accusation?)
will find this difficult to understand at first; but the
New Woman ‘knows his weakness,’ and will ‘help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>him with his lesson.’ ‘<em>Man morally is in his infancy.</em>’
There have been times when there was a doubt as
to whether he was to be raised to her level, or woman
to be lowered to his, but we ‘have turned that corner
at last and now woman holds out a strong hand to
the child-man and insists upon helping him up.’ The
child-man (Bismarck? Herbert Spencer? Edison?
Gladstone? Alexander III.? Lord Dufferin? the
Duc d’Aumale?)—the child-man must have his tottering
baby steps guided by the New Woman, and he
must be taught to live up to his ideals. To live up to
an ideal, whether our own or somebody else’s, is a
painful process; but man must be made to do it.
For, oddly enough, we are assured that despite ‘all
his assumption he does not make the best of himself,’
which is not wonderful if he be still only in his
infancy; and he has the incredible stupidity to be
blind to the fact that ‘woman has self-respect and
good sense,’ whilst he has neither, and that ‘she does
not in the least intend to sacrifice the privileges she
enjoys on the chance of obtaining others.’</p>

<p class='c001'>I have written amongst other <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pensées éparses</i></span> which
will some day see the light, the following reflection:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’école nouvelle des femmes libres oublie qu’on ne puisse
pas à la fois combattre l’homme sur son propre terrain, et
attendre de lui des politesses, des tendresses, et des galantéries.
Il ne faut pas au même moment prendre de l’homme son chaire
à l’Université et sa place dans l’omnibus; si on lui arrâche son
gagne-pain on ne peut pas exiger qu’il offre aussi sa parapluie.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The whole kernel of the question lies in this. The
supporters of the New Woman declare that she will
not surrender her present privileges, <i>i.e.</i>, though she
may usurp his professorial seat, and seize his salary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>she will still expect the man to stand that she may
sit; the man to get wet through that she may use his
umbrella. Yet surely if she retain these privileges
she can only do so by an appeal to his chivalry, <i>i.e.</i>,
by a confession that she is weaker than he. But she
does not want to do this; she wants to get the comforts
and concessions due to feebleness, at the same
time as she demands the lion’s share of power due to
superior force alone. It is this overweening and unreasonable
grasping at both positions which will end
in making her odious to man and in her being probably
kicked back roughly by him into the seclusion
of a harem.</p>

<p class='c001'>The New Woman declares that man cannot do
without woman. It is a doubtful postulate. In the
finest intellectual and artistic era of the world women
were not necessary to either the pleasures or passions
of men. It is possible that if women make themselves
as unlovely and offensive as they appear likely
to become, the preferences of the Platonic Age may
become acknowledged and dominant, and women
may be relegated entirely to the lowest plane as
a mere drudge and child-bearer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before me at the moment lies an engraving from an
illustrated journal of a woman’s meeting; whereat a
woman is demanding, in the name of her sovereign
sex, the right to vote at political elections. The
speaker is middle-aged and plain of feature; she
wears an inverted plate on her head, tied on with
strings under her double-chin; she has balloon-sleeves,
a bodice tight to bursting, a waist of ludicrous
dimensions in proportion to her portly person;
her whole attire is elaborately constructed so as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>conceal any physical graces which she might possess;
she is gesticulating with one hand, of which all the
fingers are stuck out in ungraceful defiance of all
artistic laws of gesture. Now, why cannot this
orator learn to gesticulate properly and learn to
dress gracefully, instead of clamouring for a franchise?
She violates in her own person every law,
alike of common-sense and artistic fitness, and yet
comes forward as a fit and proper person to make
laws for others. She is an exact representative of
her sex as it exists at the dawn of the twentieth
century.</p>

<p class='c001'>There have been few periods in which woman’s
attire has been so ugly, so disfiguring and so preposterous
as it is in this year of grace (1894) at a period
when, in newspaper and pamphlet, on platform and
in dining-room, and in the various clubs she has consecrated
to herself, woman is clamouring for her
recognition as a being superior to man. She cannot
clothe herself with common sense or common grace,
she cannot resist the dictates of tailors and the example
of princesses; she cannot resist the squaw-like
preference for animals’ skins, and slaughtered
birds, and tufts torn out of the living and bleeding
creature; she cannot show to any advantage the
natural lines of her form, but disguises them as grotesquely
as mantua-makers bid her to do. She cannot
go into the country without making herself a caricature
of man, in coat and waistcoat and gaiters; she apes
all his absurdities, she emulates all his cruelties and
follies; she wears his ugly pot hats, his silly, stiff
collars; she copies his inane club-life and then tells
us that this parody, incapable of initiative, bare of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>taste and destitute of common sense, is worthy to be
enthroned as the supreme teacher of the world!</p>

<p class='c001'>Woman, whether new or old, leaves immense fields
of culture untilled, immense areas of influence wholly
neglected. She does almost nothing with the resources
she possesses, because her whole energy is
concentrated on desiring and demanding those she
had not. She can write and print anything she
chooses; and she scarcely ever takes the pains to
acquire correct grammar or elegance of style before
wasting ink and paper. She can paint and model
any subjects she chooses, but she imprisons herself in
men’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>atéliers</i></span> to endeavour to steal their technique
and their methods, and thus loses any originality
she might possess in art. Her influence on children
might be so great that through them she would
practically rule the future of the world; but she delegates
her influence to the vile school boards if she be
poor, and if she be rich to governesses and tutors;
nor does she in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
ever attempt to educate or control herself into fitness
for the personal exercise of such influence. Her
precept and example in the treatment of the animal
creation might be of infinite use in mitigating the
hideous tyranny of humanity over them, but she does
little or nothing to this effect; she wears dead birds
and the skins of dead creatures; she hunts the hare
and shoots the pheasant, she drives and rides with
more brutal recklessness than men; she watches with
delight the struggles of the dying salmon, of the
gralloched deer; she keeps her horses standing in
snow and fog for hours, with the muscles of their
heads and necks tied up in the torture of the bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>rein; when asked to do anything for a stray dog, a
lame horse, a poor man’s donkey, she is very sorry,
but she has so many claims on her already; she
never attempts by orders to her household, to her
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fóurnisseurs</i></span>, to her dependents, to obtain some degree
of mercy in the treatment of sentient creatures and
in the methods of their slaughter, and she continues
to trim her court gowns with the aigrettes of
ospreys.</p>

<p class='c001'>The immense area for good influence which lies
open to her in private life is almost entirely uncultivated,
yet she wants to be admitted into public
life. Public life is already overcrowded, verbose,
incompetent, fussy and foolish enough without the
addition of her in her sealskin coat with the dead
humming bird on her hat. Women in public life
would exaggerate the failings of men, and would not
have even their few excellencies. Their legislation
would be, as that of men is too often, the offspring of
panic or prejudice; and women would not put on the
drag of common-sense as men frequently do in public
assemblies. There would be little to hope from their
humanity, nothing from their liberality; for when
they are frightened they are more ferocious than men,
and, when they gain power, more merciless.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Men,’ says one of the New Women, ‘deprived us
of all proper education and then jeered at us because
we had no knowledge.’ How far is this based on
facts? Could not Lady Jane Grey learn Greek
and Latin as she chose? Could not Hypatia lecture?
Was George Sand or Mrs Somerville withheld
from study? Could not in every age every
woman choose a Corinna or a Cordelia as her type?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>become either Helen or Penelope? If the vast
majority have not the mental or physical gifts to
become either, that is Nature’s fault, not man’s.
Aspasia and Adelina Patti were born, not made.
In all eras and all climes a woman of great genius
or of great beauty has done very much what she
chose; and if the majority of women have led
obscure lives, so have the majority of men. The
chief part of humanity is insignificant whether it be
male or female. In most people there is very little
character indeed, and as little mind. Those who
have much of either never fail to make their mark,
be they of which sex they may.</p>

<p class='c001'>The unfortunate idea that there is no good education
without a college curriculum is as injurious as
it is erroneous. The college education may have
excellencies for men in its friction, its preparation
for the world, its rough destruction of personal conceit;
but for women it can only be hardening and
deforming. If study be delightful to a woman, she
will find her way to it as the hart to water brooks.
The author of <cite>Aurora Leigh</cite> was not only always at
home, but she was also for many years a confirmed
invalid; yet she became a fine classic, and found
her path to fame. A college curriculum would have
done nothing to improve her rich and beautiful
mind; it might have done much to debase it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be impossible to love and venerate literature
of the highest kind more profoundly than did
Elizabeth Barrett Browning, yet she was the most
retiring of women and chained by weakness to her
couch until her starry-eyed and fiery suitor descended
on her and bore her away to Italy. It is difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>to see what the distinction of being called a wrangler
can add to the solid advantage and the intellectual
pleasure of studying mathematics; or what the
gaining of a college degree in classics can add to
the delightful culture of Greek and Latin literature
as sought <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The perpetual contact of men with other men
may be good for them, but the perpetual contact
of women with other women is very far from good.
The publicity of a college must be injurious to a
young girl of refined and delicate feeling, whilst the
adoration of other women (as in the late chairing of
a wrangler by other girl graduates) is unutterably
pernicious. Nor can I think the present mania for
exploration and incessant adventure beneficial either
to the woman or the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a young and good-looking girl chooses to
ride or walk all alone through a wild and unexplored
country, it must be admitted that, if the narrative of
her adventures be not sheer fable, she must have
perpetually run the risk of losing what women have
hitherto been taught to consider dearer than life. It
is nothing short of courting abuse of her maiden
person to explore all alone mountainous regions
and desert plains inhabited by wild and fierce races
of men. One such young traveller describes, amongst
other risky exploits, how she came one night in the
Carpathians upon a deep and lonely pool, made black
as the mouth of Avernus by its contrast with the moonlit
rocks around, and of how, tempted by this blackness,
she got down from her saddle, stripped, plunged and
bathed! The stars alone, she says, looked down on
this exploit, but how could this Susannah be sure there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>were no Elders? And common sense timidly whispers,
how, oh how, did she manage to dry herself?</p>

<p class='c001'>Personally, I do not in the least believe in these
stories any more than in those of the noted Munchausen;
but they are put into print as sober facts,
and as such we are requested and expected to receive
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ‘Scum-Woman’ and the ‘Cow-Woman,’ to
quote the elegant phraseology of the defenders of their
sex, are both of them less of a menace to humankind
than the New Woman with her fierce vanity, her undigested
knowledge, her overweening estimate of her
own value, and her fatal want of all sense of the
ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c001'>When scum comes to the surface it renders a great
service to the substance which it leaves behind it;
when the cow yields pure nourishment to the young
and the suffering, her place is blessed in the realm of
nature; but when the New Woman splutters blistering
wrath on mankind she is merely odious and
baneful.</p>

<p class='c001'>The error of the New Woman (as of many an old
one) lies in speaking of women as the victims of men,
and entirely ignoring the frequency with which men
are the victims of women. In nine cases out of ten
the first to corrupt the youth is the woman. In nine
cases out of ten also she becomes corrupt herself
because she likes it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Leonide Leblanc, scorning to adopt the
career of a school teacher, for which her humble
family had educated her, walked down the hill from
Montmartre to seek her fortunes in the streets of
Paris, she did so because she liked to do so, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>was indeed quite natural in her. Neither Mephistopheles
nor Faust led her down from Montmartre,
and its close little kitchen and common little bedchamber;
neither Mephistopheles nor Faust was
wanted, Paris and the boulevards were attraction
enough, and her own beauty and ambition were
spurs sufficiently sharp to make her leave the unlovely
past and seek the dazzling future. The accusation
of seduction is very popular with women, and
they excuse everything faulty in their lives with it;
but the accusation is rarely based on actual facts.
The youth and the maiden incline towards each
other as naturally as the male and female blossoms
of trees are blown together by the fertilising breeze
of spring. An attraction of a less poetic, of a wholly
physical kind, brings together the boy and girl in
the garrets, in the cellars, in the mines, on the farm
lands, in the promiscuous intercourse of the streets.
It is nature which draws the one to the other; and
the blame lies less on them than with the hypocritical
morality of a modern world which sees what
it calls sin in Nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is all very well to say that prostitutes were at
the beginning of their career victims of seduction;
but it is not probable and it is not provable. Love
of drink and of finery, and a dislike to work, are the
more likely motives and origin of their degradation.
It never seems to occur to the accusers of man that
women are just as vicious and as lazy as he is in nine
cases out of ten, and need no invitation from him to
become so.</p>

<p class='c001'>A worse prostitution than that of the streets, <i>i.e.</i>,
that of loveless marriages of convenience, are brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>about by women, not by men. In such unions the
man always gives much more than he gains, and the
woman in almost every instance is persuaded or
driven into it by women: her mother, her sisters, her
acquaintances. It is rarely that the father interferes
to bring about such a marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>A rich marriage represents to the woman of culture
and position what the streets represent to the woman
of the people. But it is none the less a loveless sale
of self, because its sale is ratified at St Paul’s Knightsbridge
or at S. Philippe du Roule.</p>

<p class='c001'>In even what is called a well-assorted marriage,
the man is frequently sacrificed to the woman. As
I wrote long ago, Andrea del Sarte’s wife has many
sisters; Correggio, dying of the burden of the family,
has many brothers. Men of genius are often pinned
to earth by their wives. They are continually
dwarfed and dulled by their female relations, and
rendered absurd by their sons and daughters. In
our own day a famous statesman is made very
ridiculous by his wife. Frequently the female influences
brought to bear on him render a man of great and
original powers and disinterested character, a time-server,
a conventionalist, a mere seeker of place.
Woman may help man sometimes, but she certainly
more often hinders him. Her self-esteem is immense
and her self-knowledge very small. I view with
dread for the future of the world the power which
modern inventions place in the hands of woman.
Hitherto her physical weakness has restrained her in
a great measure from violent action; but a woman
can make a bomb and throw it, can fling vitriol, and
fire a repeating revolver as well as any man can.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>These are precisely the deadly, secret, easily handled
modes of warfare and revenge, which will commend
themselves to her ferocious feebleness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jules Rochard has written:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘J’ai professé de l’anatomie pendant des longues années, j’ai
passé une bonne partie de mavie dans les amphithéâtres, mais
je n’en ai pas moins éprouvé un sentiment pénible en trouvant
dans toutes les maisons d’education des squelettes d’animaux
et des mannequins anatomiques entre les mains des fillettes.’</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>I suppose this passage will be considered as an
effort ‘to withhold knowledge from women,’ but it is
one which is full of true wisdom and honourable
feeling. When you have taken her into the physiological
and chemical laboratories, when you have
extinguished pity in her, and given weapons to her
dormant cruelty, which she can use in secret, you will
be hoist with your own petard—your pupil will be
your tyrant, and then she will meet with the ultimate
fate of all tyrants.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the pages of an eminent review a physician has
recently lamented the continually increasing unwillingness
of women of the world in the United States
to bear children, and the consequent increase of
ill-health; whilst to avoid child-bearing is being continually
preached to the working classes by those
who call themselves their friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>The elegant epithet of Cow-Woman implies the
contempt with which maternity is viewed by the
New Woman, who thinks it something fine to vote
at vestries, and shout at meetings, and lay bare the
spine of living animals, and haul the gasping salmon
from the river pool, and hustle male students off the
benches of amphitheatres.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Modesty is no doubt a thing of education or prejudice,
a conventionality artificially stimulated; but
it is an exquisite grace, and womanhood without it
loses its most subtle charm. Nothing tends so to
destroy modesty as the publicity and promiscuity of
schools, of hotels, of railway trains and sea voyages.
True modesty shrinks from the curious gaze of other
women as from the coarser gaze of man. When a
girl has a common bedchamber and a common
bathroom with other girls, she loses the delicate
bloom of her modesty. Exposure to a crowd of
women is just as nasty as exposure to a crowd of
men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men, moreover, are in all, except the very lowest
classes, more careful of their talk before young girls
than women are, or at least were so until the young
women of fashion insisted on their discarding such
scruples. It is very rarely that a man does not
respect real innocence; but women frequently do not.
The jest, the allusion, the story which sullies her
mind and awakes her inquisitiveness, will much
oftener be spoken by women than men. It is not
from her brothers, nor her brother’s friends, but from
her female companions that she will understand what
the grosser laugh of those around her suggests. The
biological and pathological curricula complete the
loveless disflowering of her maiden soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everything which tends to obliterate the contrast
of the sexes, like the mixture of boys and girls in
American common schools, tends also to destroy the
charm of intercourse, the savour and sweetness of life.
Seclusion lends an infinite seduction to the girl,
whilst the rude and bustling publicity of modern life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>robs woman of her grace. Packed <a id='corr220.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='liked'>like</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_220.1'><ins class='correction' title='liked'>like</ins></a></span> herrings in
a railway carriage, sleeping in odious vicinity to
strangers on a shelf, going days and nights without
a bath, exchanging decency and privacy for publicity
and observation, the women who travel, save those
rich enough to still purchase seclusion, are forced to
cast aside all refinement and delicacy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is said that travel enlarges the mind. There
are many minds which can no more be enlarged, by
any means whatever, than a nut or a stone. What
have their journeys round the world and their incessant
gyrations done for the innumerable princes
of Europe? The fool remains a fool, though you
carry him or her about over the whole surface of the
globe, and it is certain that the promiscuous contact
and incessant publicity of travel, which may not hurt
the man, do injure the woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Neither men nor women of genius are, I repeat,
any criterion for the rest of their sex; nay, they
belong, as Plato placed them, to a third sex which is
above the laws of the multitude. But even whilst
they do so they are always the foremost to recognise
that it is the difference, not the likeness, of sex which
makes the charm of human life. Barry Cornwall
wrote long ago,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As the man beholds the woman,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As the woman sees the man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Curiously they note each other,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As each other only can.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Never can the man divest her</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of that mystic charm of sex;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ever must she, gazing on him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That same mystic charm annex.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>That mystic charm will long endure, despite the
efforts to destroy it of orators, in tight stays and
balloon sleeves, who scream from platforms, and
the beings so justly abhorred of Mrs Lynn Lynton
who smoke in public carriages and from the waist
upward are indistinguishable from the men they
profess to despise.</p>

<p class='c001'>But every word, whether written or spoken, which
urges the woman to antagonism against the man,
every word which is written or spoken to try and
make of her a <a id='corr221.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hybird'>hybrid</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_221.11'><ins class='correction' title='hybird'>hybrid</ins></a></span>, self-contained opponent of
men, makes a rift in the lute to which the world
looks for its sweetest music.</p>

<p class='c001'>The New Woman reminds me of an agriculturist
who, discarding a fine farm of his own, and leaving
it to nettles, stones, thistles and wire-worms, should
spend his whole time in demanding neighbouring
fields which are not his. The New Woman will
not even look at the extent of ground indisputably
her own, which she leaves unweeded and
untilled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not to speak of the entire guidance of childhood,
which is certainly already chiefly in the hands of
woman (and of which her use does not do her much
honour), so long as she goes to see one of her own
sex dancing in a lion’s den, the lions being meanwhile
terrorised by a male brute; so long as she wears dead
birds as millinery and dead seals as coats, so long as
she goes to races, steeplechases, coursing and pigeon
matches; so long as she ‘walks with the guns’; so
long as she goes to see an American lashing horses
to death in idiotic contest with velocipedes, so long
as she curtsies before princes and emperors who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>reward the winners of distance-rides; so long as she
receives physiologists in her drawing-rooms, and
trusts to them in her maladies; so long as she
invades literature without culture, and art without
talent; so long as she orders her court-dress in a
hurry, regardless of the strain thus placed on the poor
seamstresses; so long as she makes no attempt to
interest herself in her servants, in her animals, in the
poor slaves of her tradespeople; so long as she shows
herself, as she does at present, without scruple at
every brutal and debasing spectacle which is considered
fashionable; so long as she understands
nothing of the beauty of meditation, of solitude, of
Nature; so long as she is utterly incapable of keeping
her sons out of the shambles of modern sport,
and lifting her daughters above the pestilent miasma
of modern society; so long as she is what she is in
the worlds subject to her, she has no possible title or
capacity to demand the place or the privilege of man,
for she shows herself incapable of turning to profit her
own place and her own privilege.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>DEATH AND PITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Le livre de la Pitié et de la Mort</cite></span> is the latest
and, in my estimation, in some respects, the
most touching and the most precious of the works
of Loti, and I wish that this little volume, so small
in bulk, so pregnant with thought and value, could
be translated into every language spoken upon earth,
and sped like an electric wave over the dull, deaf,
cruel multitudes of men. It is not that Loti himself
needs a larger public than he possesses. All who
have any affinity with him know every line he writes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Despite the singular absence of all scholarship in
his works—for, indeed, he might be living before the
birth of Cadmus for any allusion which he ever makes
to the art of letters—a perfect instinct of style, like the
child Mozart’s instinct for harmony, has led him to
the most exquisite grace and precision of expression,
the most accurate, as well as the most ideal realisations
in words alike of scenery and of sentiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>His earlier works were not unjustly reproached
with being <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>trop décousu</i></span>, too impressionist; but in his
later books this imperfection is no longer traceable,
they are delicately and beautifully harmonious. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>sympathetic critic has said, perhaps rightly, that
the long night-watches on the sea, the long isolation
of ocean voyages, and the removal from the common-place
conventional pressure of society in cities
and provinces have kept his mind singularly free,
original and poetic. But no other sailor has ever
produced anything beautiful, either in prose or in
verse; and the influence of the Armorican coast and
the Breton temperament have probably had more to
do with making him what he is than voyages which
leave sterile those who with sterile minds and souls
go down to the deep in ships, and come back with
their minds and their hands empty. He would have
been just what he is had he never been rocked on
any other waves than the long grey breakers of the
iron coast of Morbihan, and, to those whom from the
first have known and loved his poetic and pregnant
thoughts, even the palm leaves of the first intellectual
Academy of the world can add nothing to his merit,
nay, they seem scarcely to accord with his soul, free
as the seagull’s motion, and his sympathy wide as
that ocean which has cradled and nursed him.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is not of himself that I wish to speak here.
It is of this last little book of his which, so small in
compass, is yet vast as the universe in what it touches
and suggests. All the cultured world has, doubtless,
read it; but how little and narrow is that world compared
to the immeasurable multitudes to which the
volume will for ever remain unknown, and also to
that, alas! equally great world to which it would be,
even when read, a dead letter: for to those who have
no ear for harmony the music of Beethoven is but as
the crackling of thorns under a pot. He knows this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>and in his preface counsels such as these to leave it
alone, for it can only weary them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, the book is in absolute and uncompromising
opposition to the modern tone of his own times,
and to the bare, dry, hard temperament of his generation.
It is in direct antagonism with what is called
the scientific spirit and its narrow classifications. It
is full of altruism of the widest, purest and highest
kind, stretching out its comprehension and affection
to those innumerable races which the human race has
disinherited, driven into bondage, and sacrificed to its
own appetites and desires. To its author the ox in
the shambles, the cat in the gutter is as truly a fellow
creature as the mariner on his deck, or the mother by
his hearth; the nest of the bird is as sacred as the
rush hut of the peasant, and the cry of the wounded
animal reaches his heart as quickly as the wail of the
fisherman’s widow. No one can reproach him, as
they reproach me (a reproach I am quite willing to
accept), with thinking more of animals than of men
and women. His charities to his own kind are unceasing
and boundless; he is ever foremost in the
relief of sorrow and want. It cannot be said either
that he is what is scornfully called a ‘mere sentimentalist.’
He is well known as a daring and brilliant
officer in his service, and he has shown that he
possesses moral as well as physical courage, and that
he is careless of censure and indifferent to his own
interests and prospects when he is moved to indignation
against the tyrannies of the strong over the
weak. Here is no woman who has dreamed by her
fireside or in her rose garden until her sentiment has
overshadowed her reason, but a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>brave des braves</i></span>, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>man whose life is spent by choice in the most perilous
contest with the forces of nature, a man who has been
often under fire, who has seen war in all its sickly
horror, who has felt the lightnings of death playing
round him in a thousand shapes. His noble and
rashly-expressed indignation at the barbarities shown
in the taking of Tonquin led to his temporary banishment
from the French navy. He does prove, and has
ever proved, in his conduct as in his writings, that to
him nothing human can be alien. But he is not
hemmed in behind the narrow pale of humanitarianism:
he has the vision to see, and the courage
to show, that the uncounted, sentient, suffering
children of creation for whom humanity has no
mercy, but merely servitude and slaughter, are as
dear to him as his own kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a century which in its decrepitude has fallen
prone and helpless under the fiat of the physiologist
and bacteriologist, this attitude needs no common
courage. Browning had this courage, Renan had it
not. In an age when the idolatry of man is carried to
a height which would be ludicrous in its inflated conceit
were it not in its results so tragic, it requires no
common force and boldness to speak as Loti speaks
of the many other races of the earth as equally deserving
with their tyrants of tenderness and comprehension;
to admit, as he admits, that in the suppliant eyes
of his little four-footed companions he can see, as in
a woman’s or a child’s, the soul within speaking and
calling to his own.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘She’ (she is a little Chinese cat which had taken refuge on
board his frigate) ‘came out of the shadow, stretching herself
slowly, as if to give herself time for reflection. She came towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>me with several pauses, sometimes with a Mongolian
grace; she lifted one paw in the air before deciding to put it
down and take a further step; and all the while she gazed at
me fixedly, questioningly. I wondered what she could want
with me. I had had her well fed by my servant. When she
was quite near, very near, she sat down, brought her tail round
her legs, and made a very soft little noise. And she continued
to look at me, to look at me <em>in the eyes</em>, which indicated that
intelligent ideas were thronging through her small head. It
was evident that she understood, as all animals do, that I was
not a thing, but a thinking being, capable of pity, and accessible
to the mute entreaty of a look. Besides, it was plain that my
eyes were really eyes to her, that is, they were mirrors in which
her little soul sought anxiously to seize some reflection from my
own.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘And whilst she thus gazed at me, I let my hand droop on to
her quaint little head, and stroked her fur as my first caress.
What she felt at my touch was certainly something more than
a mere impression of physical pleasure; she had some sentiment,
some comprehension of protection and sympathy in her
forsaken misery. This was why she had ventured out of her
hiding-place in the dark; this was what she had resolved to
ask me for with diffidence and hesitation. She did not want
either to eat or drink, she only wanted a little companionship in
this lonely world, a little friendship.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘How had she learned that such things were, this stray,
hunted creature, never touched by a kind hand, never loved by
anyone, unless, perhaps, on board some junk, by some poor
little Chinese child who had neither caresses nor playthings,
sprung up by chance like a sickly plant, one too many in the
grovelling yellow crowd, as unhappy and as hungry as herself,
and of whom the incomplete soul will at its disappearance from
earth leave no more trace than hers? Then one frail paw was
timidly laid on my lap, with such infinite delicacy, such exceeding
discretion! and, after having lingeringly consulted and
implored me through the eyes, she sprang upon my lap, thinking
the moment come when she might establish intimate relations
with me. She installed herself there in a ball, with a
tact, a reserve, a lightness incredible, and always gazing up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>my face ... and her eyes becoming still more expressive,
still more winning, said plainly to mine,—</p>

<p class='c001'>‘“In this sad autumn day, since we are both alone in this
floating prison, rocked and lost in the midst of I know not what
endless perils, why should we not give to one another a little
of that sweet exchange of feeling which soothes so many sorrows,
which has a semblance of some immaterial eternal thing not
subjected to death, which calls itself affection, and finds its
expression in a touch, a look?″’</p>

touched, her eyes showing, as much as human eyes could, the
internal presence and the pain of that which we call the soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘One morning I found her stiff and cold, with glassy orbs,
a dead beast, a thing men cast out on to the dust heap. Then
I bade Sylvester dig a little grave in a corner of the courtyard,
at the foot of a shrub.... Where was gone that which
I had seen shine in her dying eyes, the little, flickering, anxious
flame from within: where was it gone?’</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Never had there been a more radiant day of June, never a
softer silence and warmth crossed by the gay buzzing of summer
flies; the courtyard was all blossom, the rose boughs covered
with roses; a sweet country calm rested on all the gardens
around; the swallows and martins slumbered; only the old
tortoise, Suleima, more widely awake the warmer it became,
travelled merrily without aim or goal over the old sun-bathed
stones. There was everywhere that melancholy of skies too
fair, of weather too fine, in the exhaustion of a hot noon-day.
All the plants, all the things, seemed to cruelly shout there the
triumph over their own perpetual new birth, without pity for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the fragile human creatures who heard that song of summer,
weighed themselves with the consciousness of their own impending,
unavoidable end.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘This garden was and is to me the oldest and most familiar
of all the places of the earth, in which all the smallest details
have been known to me from the earliest hours of the vague and
surprised impressions of infancy. So much so that I am
attached to it with all my soul; that I love with a singular force
and regard almost as my fetish the venerable plants which
grow there, its trellised branches, its climbing jessamines, and
a certain rose-coloured diclytra which every month of March
displays on the same spot its early-burgeoning leaves, sends
out its flowers in April, grows yellow in the suns of June, and
at last, burnt up by August, seems to give up the ghost and
perish.... And with an infinite melancholy, in this place so
gay with the fresh sunlight of a young year, I watched the two
beloved figures with white hair and mourning gowns, my mother
and Aunt Claire, going and coming, leaning down over a flower
border as they had done so many years to see what blossoms
were already opening, or raising their heads to look at the buds
of the creepers and the roses. And when the two black robes
went onward and became farther away in the far perspective of
a long green avenue, I saw how much slower was their step, how
bent were their forms. Alas for that time too close at hand
when in the green avenue which would be ever the same, I
should behold their shadows no more! Is it possible that a
time will ever come when they shall have left this life? I feel
as if they will not entirely depart so long as I myself shall be
here, to invoke their benevolent presence, and that in the
summer evenings I shall still see their blessed shades pass under
the old jessamines and vines, and that something of their spirit
will remain to me in the plants which they cherished, in the
drooping boughs of the honeysuckle and in the rosy petals of
the old diclytra!’</p>

<p class='c001'>He feels, and feels intensely, the similarity of sentiment
between himself and all other forms of sentient
life. He is not ashamed to perceive and acknowledge
that the emotions of the animal are absolutely the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>same in substance as our own, and differ from ours
only in degree. Could this knowledge become
universal it would go far to make cruelty impossible
in man, but as yet it has only been realised and
admitted by the higher minds of a very few, such as
his own, as Tennyson’s, as Wordsworth’s, as Browning’s,
as Lecomte de Lisle’s, as Sully Prudhomme’s;
it requires humility and sympathy in the human
breast of no common kind; it is the absolute antithesis
of the vanity and egotism of what is called the
scientific mind, although more truly scientific, that is,
more logical, than the bombast and self-worship of
the biologist and physiologist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Loti sees and feels that the little African cat from
Senegal, which he brought to his own Breton home, is
moved by the same feelings as himself, and in a more
pathetic because a more helpless way, and he has
remorse for a momentary unkindness to her as though
she were living still.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘It was one day when, with the obstinacy of her race, she had
jumped where she had been twenty times forbidden to go, and
had broken a vase to which I was much attached. I gave her
a slap at first; then, my anger not satiated, I pursued her and
kicked her with my foot. The slap had only surprised her, but
the kick told her that it was war between us; and then she fled
as fast as four legs would take her, her tail like a feather in the
wind. When safe under a piece of furniture she turned round
and cast at me a look of reproach and distress, believing herself
lost, betrayed, and assassinated by one beloved, into whose
hands she had entrusted her fate; and as my look at her
remained hostile and unkind, she gave vent to the great cry of
a creature at bay. Then all my wrath ceased in one instant: I
called her, I caressed her, I soothed her, taking her on my
knees all breathless and terrified. Oh, that last cry of despair
from an animal, whether from the poor ox tied to the slaughter-place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>or of the miserable rat held in the teeth of a bull-dog—that
last cry which hopes nothing, which appeals to no one,
which is like a supreme protestation thrown in the face of
Nature, an appeal to some unknown pity floating in the air.
Now all which remains of my little cat, whom I remember so
living and so droll, are a few bones in a hole at the foot of a tree.
And her flesh, her little person, her affection for me, her infinite
terror that day she was scolded, her great joy, her anguish and
reproach—all, in a word, which moved and lived, and had their
being around these bones—all have become but a little dust!’</p>

has done wrong to end for it that poor little atom of
joyless, friendless life, which was all that it could call
its own.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is its story,—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘An old, mange-eaten cat, driven away from its home, no
doubt by its owner, for its age and infirmities, had established
itself in the street on the doorstep of our house, where a little
warmth from a November sun came to comfort it. It is a habit
of certain people who call their selfishness sensibility to send out
to be purposely lost, the creatures which they will not take care
of any longer, and do not desire to see suffer. All the day he
had sat there, piteously huddled in a corner of a window,
looking so unhappy and so humble! An object of disgust to all
the passers-by, threatened by children, by dogs, by continual
dangers, every hour more ill and feeble, eating Heaven knows
what rubbish, got with difficulty out of the gutter, he dragged
out his existence, prolonging it as best he might, trying to retard
the moment of his death. His poor head was covered with
scabs and sores, and had scarcely any fur left on it, but his eyes
remained pretty, and seemed full of thought. He had certainly
felt, in all the frightful bitterness of his lot, that last degradation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>of all, the inability to make his toilette, to polish his coat, to
wash and comb himself as all cats love to do so carefully. It
hurt me so to see this poor lost animal that, after having sent
him food into the street, I approached him and spoke to him
gently. (Animals soon understand kind words, and are consoled
by them.) Having been so often hunted and driven away,
he was at first frightened at seeing me near him; his first look
was timid, suspicious, at once a reproach and a prayer! Then
soon comprehending that I was there from sympathy, and
astonished at so much happiness, he addressed me in his own
way: ‘Trr! Trr! Trr!’ getting up out of politeness, trying,
despite his mangy state, to arch his back in the hope that I
should stroke him. But the pity I felt for him, though great,
could not go as far as that. The joy of being caressed he was
never to know again. But in compensation it occurred to me that
it would be kind to end his life of pain by giving him a gentle,
dreamful death. An hour later, Sylvester, my servant, who had
bought some chloroform, drew him gently into our stable, and
induced him to lie down on some warm hay in an osier basket
which was destined to be his mortuary chamber. Our preparations
did not disturb him: we had rolled a card into a cone-shaped
form, as we had seen the ambulance surgeon do; he had
looked at us with a contented look, thinking he had at last found
a lodging and people who had pity on him, new owners who
would shelter him.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Despite the horror of his disease, I stooped over him and
stroked him, and, always caressing him, I induced him to lie
still, and to bury his little nose in the cone of cardboard; he, a
little surprised at first, and sniffing the strange, potent odour with
alarm, ended however in doing what I wished with such docility
that I hesitated to continue my work. The annihilation of a
thinking creature is, equally with annihilation of man, a cruel
and responsible thing, and contains the same revolting mystery.
And death, besides, carries in itself so much majesty that it is
capable of giving grandeur in an instant to the most tiny and
finite creatures, as soon as its shadow descends on them. Once
he raised his poor head to look at me fixedly; our eyes met, his
with an expressive interrogation, an intense anxiety, asked me,
“What is it that you do? You whom I know so little, but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>whom I trusted—what is it that you do to me?” And I still
hesitated; but his throat inclined downwards, and his face rested
on my hand, which I did not withdraw; stupefaction had begun
to steal over him, and I hoped that he would not look at me
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘And yet, yes, once again! Cats, as the village people here
say, have their lives united to their bodies. In one last struggle
for life his eyes met mine; across his mortal semi-sleep he
seemed now to perceive and understand: “Ah! it was to kill
me, then? Well, I let you do it! It is too late—I sleep!”</p>

<p class='c001'>‘In truth, I feared I had done ill. In this world, where we
know nothing surely of anything, it is not even allowed us to let
pity take this shape. His last look, infinitely sad, even whilst
glazing in death, continued to pursue me with reproach.
“Why,” it said, “why interfere with my fate? Without you I
should have dragged my life on a little longer, had a few more
little thoughts. I had still strength to jump up on a window-sill,
where the dogs could not reach me; where I was not too
cold in the morning, especially if the sun shone there. I still
passed some bearable hours watching the movement in the
street, seeing other cats come and go, having consciousness
of what was doing round me, whilst now there is nothing for me
but to rot away for ever into something which will have no
memory. <em>Now I am no more!</em>” Truly, I should have recollected
that the feeblest and poorest things prefer to linger on
under the most miserable conditions, prefer no matter what
suffering to the terror of being nothing, of <em>being no more</em>.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>And he cannot forgive himself an act which was
meant out of kindness, but in which the regard of the
dying animal makes him see almost a crime. This
tenderness for every breathing thing, this sentiment
of the infinite, intense pity and mystery which accompany
all forms of death is ever present with him, and
nothing in its hour of dissolution is too small or too
fragile, or too mean or too miserable, in his sight not
to arouse this in him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Read only the story of the <cite>Sorrow of an Old Galley
Slave</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This old man, who has been in prison many times,
is at last being sent out to New Caledonia. ‘Old as I
am, could they not have let me die in France?’ he
says to our friend Yves (Mon Frére Yves), who is
gone with his gunboat to take a band of these
prisoners from the shore to the ship in which they are
to make their voyage. Encouraged by the sympathy
of Yves in his impending exile, the old felon shows him
his one treasure; it is a little cage with a sparrow in it.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘It is a tame bird, that knows his voice, and has learnt to sit
on his shoulder. It was a year with him in his cell, and with
great difficulty he has obtained permission to carry it with him
to Caledonia, and, the permission once obtained, with what
trouble he has made a little cage for it to travel in, to get the
bits of wood and wire necessary, and a little green paint to
brighten it and make it look pretty!</p>

<p class='c001'>‘“Poor sparrow!” says Yves to me afterwards when he tells
me this tale. “It had only a few crumbs of prison bread such
as they give to convicts, but he seems quite happy all the same.
He jumps about gaily like any other bird.”</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Later still, as the train reaches the transport ship, he, who
has forgotten for the moment the old man and the sparrow,
passes by the former, who holds out to him the little cage. “Take
it,” says the old prisoner, in a changed voice. “I give it to you;
perhaps you may like to use it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>‘“No, no,” says Yves, astonished. “You know you are going
to take it with you. The bird will be your little comrade there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>‘“Ah,” answers the old man, “he is no longer in it. Did you
not know? He is no longer here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>‘And two tears of unspeakable grief rolled down his withered
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘During a rough moment of the crossing the door of the cage
had blown open, the sparrow had fluttered, frightened, and in a
second of time had fallen into the sea, his wings, which had been
clipped, not being able to sustain him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>‘Oh, that moment of horrible pain! To see the little thing
struggle and sink, borne away on the tearing tide, and to be
unable to do anything to save him! At first, in a natural
movement of appeal, he was on the point of crying for help, of
begging them to stop the boat, of entreating for pity, for aid;
but his impulse is checked by the consciousness of his own
personal degradation. Who would have pity on a miserable
old man like him? Who would care for his little drowning
bird? Who would hearken to his prayer?</p>

<p class='c001'>‘So he keeps silence, and is motionless in his place while
the little grey body floats away on the frothing waves, quivering
and struggling always against its fate. And he feels now all
alone—frightfully alone for evermore, and his tears dull his sight,
the slow salt tears of lonely despair, of a hopeless old age.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘And a young prisoner, chained to his side, laughs aloud to see
an old man weep.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Was anything more beautiful than this ever written
in any tongue?</p>

<p class='c001'>Loti stretches to a nobler and a truer scope the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nihil humani a me alienum puto</i></span>. To him nothing
which has in it the capacity of attachment and of
suffering is alien; and it is this sentiment, this sympathy
which breathe through all his written pages
like the fragrance of some pressed and perfumed
blossom. It is these which make his influence so
admirable, so precious, in an age which is choked to
the throat in suffocating egotisms and vanities, and
bound hand and foot in the ligaments of a preposterous
and purblind formalism of exclusive self-adoration.

<p class='c001'>‘In the midst of the Indian Ocean one sad evening when the
wind began to rise.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>‘Two poor bullocks remained of a dozen which we had taken
on board at Singapore, to be eaten on the voyage. These last
two has been saved for the greatest need, because the voyage
was protracted and the ship blown backward by the wicked
monsoon.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘They were two poor creatures, weak, thin, piteous to see,
their skin already broken about their starting bones by the rude
shaking of the waves. They had journeyed thus many days,
turning their backs to their native pastures, whither no one
would ever lead them again; tied up shortly by the horns, side
by side, lowering their heads meekly every time that a wave
broke over them and drenched their bodies in its chilly wash;
their eyes dull and sad, they munched together at bad hay,
soaked and salted; condemned beasts, already struck off the
roll of the living, but fated to suffer long before they would be
killed—to suffer from cold, from blows, from sickness, from wet,
from want of movement, from fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘The evening of which I speak was especially melancholy.
At sea there are many such evenings, when ugly, livid clouds
drag along on the horizon as the light fades, when the wind
arises and the night threatens to be bad. Then when one feels
oneself isolated in the midst of these infinite waters, one is
seized with a vague terror that twilight on shore would never
bring with it even in the dreariest places. And these two poor
bullocks, creatures of the meadow and its fresh herbage, more
out of their element than men on this heaving and rolling
desert, and not having like us any hope to sustain them, were
forced, despite their limited intelligence, to endure in their
manner all this suffering, and must have seen confusedly the
image of their approaching death. They chewed the cud with
the slowness of sickness, their big, joyless eyes fixed on the
sinister distances of the sea. One by one their companions
had been struck down on these boards by their side; during
two weeks they had lived alone, drawn together by their loneliness,
leaning one against another in the rolling of the ship,
rubbing their horns against each other in friendship.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘The person charged with provisioning the ship came to me
on the bridge, and said to me in the usual formula: “Captain,
they are about to kill a bullock.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>‘I received him ill, though it was not his fault that he came
on such an errand. The slaughter of animals took place just
underneath the bridge, and in vain one turned away one’s eyes
or tried to think of other things, or gazed over the waste of
waters. One could not avoid hearing the blow of the mallet
struck between the horns in the centre of the poor forehead
held down so low to the floor by an iron buckle; then the crash
of the falling animal, who drops on the bridge with a clashing
of bone upon wood. And immediately after it is bled, skinned,
cut in pieces; an atrocious, nauseous odour comes from its opened
belly, and all around the planks of the vessel, so clean at other
times, are soiled and inundated with blood and filth.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Well, the moment had come to slay one of the bullocks.
A circle of sailors was formed round the iron ring to which it
was to be fastened for execution. Of the pair they choose the
weaker, one which was almost dying and which allowed itself
to be led away without resistance.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Then the other one turned its head to follow its companion
with its melancholy eyes, and seeing that its friend was led to
the fatal corner where all the others had fallen, <em>it understood</em>;
a gleam of comprehension came into the poor bowed head, and
it lowed loudly in its sore distress. Oh, that moan of this poor,
solitary creature! It was one of the most grievous sounds that
I have ever heard, and at the same time one of the most
mysterious. There were in it such deep reproach to us, to
men, and yet a sort of heart-broken resignation, I know not
what, of restrained and stifled grief, as if he, mourning, knew
that his lament was useless and that his appeal would be heard
by none. “Ah, yes,” it said, “the inevitable hour has come for
him who was my last remaining brother, who came with me
from our home far away, there where we used to run together
through the grass. And my turn will come soon, and not a
living thing in the world will have any pity either for him or me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>‘But I who heard had pity.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘I was even beside myself with pity, and a mad impulse
came over me to go and take his big, sickly, mangy head to
rest it on my heart, since that is our instinctive caress by which
to offer the illusion of protection to those who suffer or who
perish. But truly indeed he could look for no succour from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>anyone, for even I, whose soul had thrilled with pain at the
intense anguish of his cry, even I remained motionless and
impassive in my place, only turning away my eyes. For the
despair of a mere animal should one change the direction of a
vessel and prevent three hundred men from eating their share of
fresh meat? One would be considered a lunatic if one only
thought of such a thing for a moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘However, a little cabin boy, who, perhaps, was also himself
alone in the world, and had found none to pity him, had heard
the cry—had heard it and been moved by it like myself to the
depths of his soul. He went up to the bullock and very
softly stroked its muzzle. He might have said to it, had he
thought to do so,—</p>

<p class='c001'>‘“They will all die too, those who are waiting to eat your
flesh to-morrow. Yes, all of them, even the youngest and
strongest, and maybe their last hour will be more terrible than
yours, and with longer pain. Perhaps it would be better for
them if they too had a blow of the pole-axe on their foreheads.”</p>

<p class='c001'>‘The animal returned affectionately the boy’s caress, gazing
at him with grateful, kind eyes, and licking his hand.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The cynic will demur that this compassion for
cattle will not prevent the human eater from consuming
his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bœuf à la mode</i></span>, or his slice from the sirloin,
with appetite. But even if cattle must be slaughtered,
how much might their torture be alleviated were men
not wholly indifferent to it. The frightful infamies
of the cattle trade on sea would be ended were none
bought after a voyage. The hideous deaths by
drought and by cold, all over the plains of South
America, would be no more. No longer would a
single living bullock endure thirty agonising operations
on his quivering body, when fastened down to
the demonstrating or experimenting table of veterinary
students. It is not so much death itself, when
swift, sure, almost painless, which is terrible, as it is
the agony, protracted, infinite, frightful, incalculable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>which is inflicted for the passions, the pleasure, or
the profit of men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were such sympathy as breathes through the <cite>Book
of Pity and of Death</cite> largely felt, all the needless
cruelty inflicted by the human race, that mere carelessness
and indifference of which the world is so full,
would gradually be reduced until it might in time
cease entirely. The cruelty of the rich to horses from
mere want of thought alone is appalling. Few know or
care how their stables are managed, what is the maximum
of work which should be demanded of a horse,
and what the torture inflicted by certain methods of
breaking-in and harnessing and driving. Frequently
are to be seen the advertisements by carriage-makers
of ‘one-horse broughams, warranted for hill work and
to carry four persons, with, if desired, a basket on
roof for railway luggage.’ That these abominable
loads are given to one horse continually there can be no
doubt, as these announcements are frequent in all the
newspapers, and never seem to elicit any wonder or
censure. A shabby and vicious economy constantly
gives, in this extravagant and spendthrift generation,
a load to one poor horse which would certainly, in a
generation earlier, and undoubtedly in a century ago,
only have been given to a pair of horses or even to
two pairs with postillions. Speed, also, being insisted
on, no matter what load is dragged, the race of
carriage-horses grows weaker and weaker in build and
stamina. What woman, either, in any capital of the
world, thinks for a moment of keeping her horses out
in rain and snow, motionless for hours, whilst she is
chattering in some warm and fragrant drawing-room,
or dancing and flirting in some cotillon? No attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>is ever given to the preferences, tastes and affections
of animals, which yet are undoubtedly of great
strength and tenacity in them, not only towards their
owners, but often, also, towards their own kind. I am,
at the present moment, driving a mare who was always
driven with her sister, who died eighteen months ago.
She does not forget her sister, and the stable companion
given her instead she hates, and endeavours,
with all her might, to kick and bite across the pole
and in the stalls. I owned also a pony so attached to
his comrade that they could live in the same loose-box
together, and when the companion died, this pony was
miserable, whinnied and neighed perpetually, lost
health, and in a few months died also. In life he was
the humble and devoted slave of his brother, would
fondle him, clean him, follow him about in all directions,
and show to him every testimony of affection
possible in one creature to another. Yet such feelings
as these, although very common in animals, are
never remembered or considered for an instant, and
animals of all kinds are sold from owner to owner, and
hustled from place to place, with no more regard
than if they were chairs and tables. What they
suffer from strange voices, new homes, and unfamiliar
treatment no one inquires, for no one cares. Convenience
and profit are all which are considered. There is
little or no remembrance of the idiosyncrasy of each
creature. The ecstatic, ardent, nervous temperament
of the dog; the timid, imaginative, impulsive mind of
the horse; the shrinking shyness of the sheep, the
attachment to place and people of the wildest or
silliest creature when once kindly treated and long
domesticated—all these things are never recollected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>or considered in dealing with them. Hard and fast
rules are laid down for them, by which they, in their
various ways, are forced to abide. Their natural
instincts and desires are treated as crimes, and their
longings and preferences are unnoticed or thwarted.
Who ever thinks of or cares for the injustice and
cruelty concentrated in that single phrase, ‘<em>The hounds
were whipped off</em>,’ or its pendant, ‘<em>The fox was broken
up</em>,’ etc., etc.? They are sentences so common, and
so often used, that the horrible cruelty involved in
them has altogether passed out of notice. Men and
women grow up amidst cruelty, and are so accustomed
to it, that they no more perceive it than they do the
living organisms in the air they breathe or in the water
they drink. Were it otherwise they could not walk
down Ludgate Hill or up Montmartre without unbearable
pain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grief of the ox driven from his pastures, of
the cow divided from her calf, of the dog sent away
from his master, of the lion torn from his desert or
jungle, of the ape brought to die of nostalgia in
cold climes, of the eagle chained down in inaction
and gloom, of all the innumerable creatures taken
from their natural life or their early associations,
because the whim, the appetite, the caprice, the
pleasure or the avarice of men is gratified or tempted
by their pain, never moves anyone to pity. They are
‘subject-creatures’ in the human code, and what they
may suffer, or may not suffer, is of no import; of less
import even than the dying out of the Maoris, or
the dwindling away of the Red Indian tribes, or the
death of African porters on the caravan routes.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is said that there is less cruelty now than in earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>times, because some public spectacles of cruelty have
been put down in many countries. But since this age
is the most exacting in small things, the most egotistic,
the most silly, and the most nervous which the world
has seen, it is probable that its increased interference
with animal liberty, and its increased fear of them
(not to mention its many increased means of animal
destruction and torture, whether for sport or experiment)
have diminished their freedom and multiplied
their sacrifice. Freedom of choice and act is the first
condition of animal as of human happiness. How
many animals in a million have even relative freedom
in any moment of their lives? No choice is ever
permitted to them; and all their most natural instincts
are denied or made subject to authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>If old pictures and old drawings and etchings are
any criterion of the modes of life of their own day,
there can be no doubt that animals were much freer
and much more intimately associated with men in
earlier times than they are now. In their representations
we see no banqueting scene without the handsome
dogs stretched upon the rushes or before the
daïs; no village fair without its merry mongrels
running in and out between the rustics’ legs: no
triumph of emperor or ceremonial of cardinal or
pope without the splendid retriever and the jewel-collared
hound: in the pictures of the Nativity the
animals are always represented as friendly and interested
spectators; in scenes from the lives of saints
the introduction of animals wild and tame are constant;
therefore, as we know that all these old painters
and etchers depicted invariably what they saw around
them, it is certain that they were accustomed to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>in their daily haunts animals made part and parcel
of men’s common life. Those animals were roughly
treated, may be, as men themselves then were, but
they were regarded as comrades and companions,
not as alien creatures to be despised and unremembered
except for use and profit. When the knight
offered up his falcon his heart was rent, as in parting
from a brother most beloved.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a fearful thought that were not animals considered
to contribute to the convenience, the profit
and the amusement of men, they would not be allowed
to live for a half-century longer. They would be
destroyed as ruthlessly as the buffalo of the United
States of America has already been, and all birds
would be exterminated as well without remorse.
There is no honour, no decency shown in the treatment
of animals and birds by men. When Menelek
sent, as a gift to Carnot, his two tame young lions,
who had been free in his rude African palace, and
were only eighteen months old, the receiver of the
gift could give them nothing better than a narrow
cage in the Jardin des Plantes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even the lovely plumage and the great agricultural
utility of the thistle-seed-eating goldfinch does not
save him from being trapped, shot, poisoned, caged,
as the ignorance, greed, or pleasure of his human foes
may choose. Nothing is too large or too small, too
noble or too innocent, to escape the rapacity, the
brutality, and the egotism of men; and in the schools
all the world over there is never a syllable said which
could by suggestion or influence awaken the minds
of the attendant pupils to a wider, gentler, and truer
sense of the relations of animals and birds to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>human race. Indeed, it would be almost ridiculous
to attempt to do so when no princeling makes a royal
visit or an Eastern tour without slaughtering, by
hundreds and by thousands, tame birds and untamed
beasts; when in every market and every shambles
the most atrocious suffering is inflicted openly and
often needlessly; when the imperial and royal persons
find their chief diversion and distraction in rending
the tender flesh of hares and pheasants, of elk and
chamois with shot and bullet; and when the new
scientific lexicons opened to them teach children how
to make a white rabbit ‘blush’ by the severance of
certain sensitive nerves, and bid them realise that in
the pursuit of ‘knowledge,’ or even of fantastic conjecture,
it is worthy and wise to inflict the most hellish
tortures on the most helpless and harmless of sentient
creatures. To sacrifice for experiment, or pleasure,
or gain, all the other races of creation, is the doctrine
taught by precept and example from the thrones
the lecture-desks, the gunrooms, and the laboratory-tables
of the world. It is not a doctrine which can
make either a generous or a just generation. Youth
is callous and selfish of itself, and by its natural
instincts; and all the example and tuition given from
palace, pulpit and professorial chair are such as to
harden its callousness and confirm its selfishness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even the marvellous sagacity, docility and kindness
of the elephant do not protect him from being slain
in tens of thousands, either for the mere value of his
tusks, or for the mere pleasure and pride taken by
men in his slaughter. Even so inoffensive a creature
as the wild sheep of the hills of Asia is mercilessly
hunted down and shot by European sportsmen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>although his carcass is absolutely of no use or value
whatever when found, and it is usually lost by the
shot creature falling down a precipice or into some
inaccessible nullah. Nearer at home the chamois and
ibex have been so treated that they will ere long
be extinct on the European continent. To wild
creatures there is no kind of compassion or of justice
ever shown. I have known an officer relate without
shame how, when he was once sleeping in a tent on
the plains of India, a leopard entered between the
folds of the canvas, and as he awoke stood still and
looked at him, then quietly turned round and went
out again; he stretched out his arm for his revolver,
and shot, as it passed out into the air, the creature
which had spared him. There is no decency, no
common ordinary feeling or conscientiousness, in
men in their dealings with animals. They publish
their advertisements without compunction of ‘geldings’
and ‘bullocks,’ and inflict castration wholesale
whenever they deem it to their profit or convenience
to do so, whether their prey be a bull or a cock, a
colt or a puppy. When the gourmand feels his ‘belly
with fat capon lined,’ the atrocious suffering by which
the capon has been swollen to unnatural obesity
never troubles him for a moment, nor when he eats
his pâté de Strasbourg has he any feelings or remembrance
for the geese with their webbed feet nailed
down to the boards before the sweltering fires.</p>

<p class='c001'>England has lately lamented the loss of a young
man of royal birth, and of gentle and kindly disposition,
who died under circumstances which touched the
national sentiment. Yet the Duke of Clarence, of
whom it was said that he would not have willingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>wronged a living being, passed his last days on
earth, the days in which he already felt the chills and
languor of impending sickness, in the slaughter
of tame birds. There is something shocking in
the thought that, during the last hours in which
an amiable youth enjoyed the gladness of the air
and the freedom of the woods, he should have been
solely occupied in taking the life of innocent and
happy creatures, reared merely to offer this miserable
diversion to him and his. This degraded sport, the
curse, the shame and the peril of England, has never
had passed on it a commentary more severe, a sarcasm
more scathing than the words, ‘<em>There will be
no shooting until after the royal funeral</em>,’ which were
announced at, and of, innumerable country-house
parties; the sacrifice of the idolised amusement being
emphasised as the most complete expression of woe
and regret possible to the nation. It would be ridiculous,
were it not sickening, that in a land where men
prate from morning till night of public duty, and
make boast of their many virtues, public and private,
no shame is attached to the shameful fact that all its
gentlemen of high degree, all its males who have
leisure and large means, find no other pursuit or
pleasure possible in autumn and winter than the
innocent slaughter or maiming of winged creatures,
reared merely to furnish them with such diversion.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is inconceivable that reasonable beings, who
claim to exercise preponderance in the influence and
direction of public affairs, should not perceive how
injurious and debasing as an example is this foolish
and cruel pursuit which they have allowed to obtain
over them all the force of habit, and all the sanctity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>of a religion. Common rights are sacrificed, harmless
privileges abolished, old paths blocked, pleasant time-consecrated
rights of way are forbidden through copse
and furze and covert, all wild natural woodland life
is destroyed by the traps, poisons and guns of the
keepers and their myrmidons, and incessant torture
of woodland animals, and incessant irritation of rural
populations go on without pause or check, in order
that princes, gentlemen and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rastaquouères</i></span> may pass
week after week, month after month, year after year,
in this kind of carnage which is delightful to them,
and at which their women unashamed are encouraged
to assist. ‘Walking with the guns’ has now become
a favourite and fashionable feminine amusement. In
the middle of the day both sexes indulge in those rich
dishes and stimulating drinks, which are their daily
fare, and carry typhoid fever into their veins; and
after luncheon, replete and content, they all return to
the organised slaughter in the leafless woodlands, or
the heather-covered moors, or the ‘happy autumn
fields.’ The gladiatorial shows of Rome might be
more brutal, but were at least more manly than this
‘sport,’ which is the only active religion of the so-called
‘God-serving classes.’ It is hereditary, like
scrofula; the devouring ambition of the baby-heir of
a great house is to be old enough to go out with the
keepers; and instinct against such slaughter, if it
existed in his childish soul, would be killed by ridicule;
example, precept and education are all bent to
one end, to render him a slayer of creatures wild and
tame. If he make later on the tour of the world, his
path over its continents will be littered by dead game,
large and small, from the noble elephant to the simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>wild sheep, from the peaceful and graminivorous elk
to the hand-fed pheasant. There is no escape for
him; even if he have little natural taste for it, he will
affect to have such taste, knowing that he will otherwise
be despised by his comrades, and be esteemed
a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lusus naturæ</i></span> in his generation. He will not dare
to be ‘odd’; the gun is the weapon of the gentleman,
as in other days was the rapier or the sword;
the gunroom is his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Academe</cite></span>; he is learned in the
choice of explosive bullets, and can explain precisely
to any fair companion the manner in which they rend
and tear the tender flesh of the forest animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Read this exploit of sport, printed by a Mr Guillemard,
apparently without the slightest sense of shame.
He is in the pursuit of ‘bighorn’ (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ovis nivicola</i></span>),
animals, perfectly innocent and harmless, living in
the wilds of Kamschatka.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘One, which appeared to carry the best horns, was more or
less hidden by some rocks, but the other stood broadside on
upon a little knoll, throwing up his head from time to time....
Resting my rifle on the ground, I took the easier shot. There
was no excuse for missing, and as the bullet <em>made the well-known
sound dear to the heart of the sportsman, I saw that it
had broken the shoulder</em>, and the animal, staggering a yard or
two, fell over seawards and was lost to view.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It is lost irrevocably. The joy of having slaughtered
him is not, however, the less.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little farther on the sportsman suddenly comes
upon ‘a very much astonished bighorn; a fine old ram
of the fifth or sixth year.’</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘I fired almost before I was conscious of it, but not a moment
too soon, for the beast was in the act of turning as I touched the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>trigger. It was his last voluntary movement, and the next
instant he was rolling down the precipice.... <em>The fun was not
yet over</em>, for, perched upon a bare pinnacle, stood another of
our quarry. The animal had been driven into a corner by some
of our party on the cliff above. The next instant, after a vain
but desperate effort to save himself, he was whirling through four
hundred feet of space.... On going up to him I found one of
the massive horns broken short off, and the whole of the hind
quarters shattered into a mass of bleeding pulp.... Our decks
were like a butcher’s shop on Boxing Day.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>And the scene seems so beautiful to him that he
photographs it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the tone which is general and which is considered
becoming when speaking or writing of the
brutal slaughter of harmless creatures. No perception
of its disgusting callousness, its foul unseemliness,
ever visits writer or reader, speaker or hearer.</p>

<p class='c001'>When men kill in self-defence it is natural; when
they kill for food it is excusable; but to kill for
pleasure and for paltry pride is vile. How long will
such pleasure and such pride be the rule of the
world? They give the strongest justification that
Anarchists can claim. If the heart of Tourguenieff
could be put into every human breast, the quail
would be a dear little feathered friend to all; but as
the world is now made, the story of Tourguenieff’s
quail would be read in vain to deaf ears, or, if heard,
would be drowned in peals of inane laughter. Could
that sense of solidarity of community between animals
and ourselves, which is so strongly realised by Pierre
Loti, be communicated to the multitude of men,
cruelty would not entirely cease, because men and
women are frequently horribly cruel to each other,
and to dependents, and to children, and to inferior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and subject human races, but cruelty to animals
would then be placed on the same plane as cruelty to
human beings, would be regarded by society with
loathing, and punished by the severity of law, as
cruelty in many forms to human creatures is now
punished. Whereas, now not only are all punishments
of cruelty, other than to man, so slight as to
mean hardly anything at all, in fact, totally inefficient
and wholly inadequate,<a id='rJ' /><a href='#fJ' class='c015'><sup>[J]</sup></a> but the vast mass of cruelty
to animals, the daily continual brutal offences against
them of their owners and employers, is placed, perforce,
entirely out of reach of any punishment whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c001'>A man can chain up his dog in filth and misery;
the rider may cut his horse to pieces at his caprice;
the woman may starve and beat her cat; the landowner
may have traps set all over his lands for fur
and feather; the slaughterer of cattle may bungle
and torture at his pleasure; the lady may wear the
dead bodies of birds on her head and on her gown;
the mother may buy puppies and kittens, squirrels
and marmosets, rabbits and guinea-pigs, to be the
trembling plaything of her little children, tormented
by these in ignorance and in maliciousness till death
releases the four-footed slaves; all these and ten
thousand other shapes and kinds of cruelty are most
of them not punishable by law. Indeed, no law
could in many instances find them out and reach
them, for the cruelty often goes on behind the closed
doors of house and stable, kennel-yard and cattleshed,
nursery of the rich and garret of the poor. No law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>can reach it in its aggregate; law is indeed, as it
stands, poor and meagre everywhere, but cruelty
could not, by any alteration of it, be really abolished.
To be eradicated, it must become a revolting thing in
the eyes of men; it must offend their conscience and
their love of justice. It would do this in time, could
such a sense of unison with animals as is the inspiring
motive of the <cite>Book of Pity and of Death</cite> become
general in humanity. There is little hope that it ever
will, but the world would be a lovelier dwelling-place
if it could be so.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rome, it is tritely said, had no monument to Pity.
Yet it was the Romans by whom the man was stoned
who slew the dove which sought refuge in his breast.
The multitudes of the present day are, all over the
world, below those Romans in sentiment. Their
farmers shoot even the swallows which build confidingly
beneath the eaves of their roofs. Their gentry
cause to be trapped and slain all the innocent birds
which shelter and nest in their woods. The down of
jays’ breasts flutters on the fans of their drawing-room
beauties, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>lophophores</i></span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>colibri</i></span> sparkle in death
upon their hair. If in a mob of Londoners, Parisians,
New Yorkers, Berliners, Melbourners, a dove fluttered
down to seek a refuge, a hundred dirty hands would
be stretched out to seize it, and wring its neck; and
if any one with the pity of old Rome tried to save
and cherish it, he would be rudely bonneted, and
mocked, and hustled amidst the brutal guffaws of
roughs, lower and more hideous in aspect and in
nature than any animal which lives. There is no true
compassion in that crowd of opposed yet mixing
races which, for want of a better word, we call the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>modern world. There is too great a greed, too
common a selfishness, for the impersonal and pure
feeling to be general in it. Yet, as children are born
cruel, but may often be taught, by continual example
and perception, kindness and self-sacrifice, so perchance
might the multitudes be led to it were there
any to teach it as Francis of Assisi taught it in
his generation, were there any to cry aloud against
its infamy with the force and the fervour of a Bruno,
of a Bernard, of a Benedict.</p>

<p class='c001'>St Francis would have walked with Loti hand
in hand, through the olive-trees, with the good wolf
between them; and what beautiful things the trio
would have said to each other!</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Churches have never heeded the teaching
of Assisi; they have never cared for or inculcated
tenderness to the other races of creation in which,
whether winged or four-footed, the preacher of Assisi
recognised his brethren. They have been puffed up
with the paltry pride of human self-admiration; and
they are now being outbid and outrun in influence
and popularity by the teachers of that still more
brutal, more narrow, and more vainglorious creed
which calls itself science, in which as many crimes
are perpetrated as in the name of liberty.</p>

<p class='c001'>As all religions reign awhile, then pass and perish,
so will the reign of science; but very possibly not
before its example and demands will have destroyed
on the face of the planet all races except man, who
in his turn will become nought on the exhausted
surface of a dead earth. Meantime, whilst those
whom we call inferior creatures are still with us,
while the birds people the air which would be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>empty without them, and the beasts live around us
with their pathetic eyes, their wise instincts, their
long, patient, unrewarded forbearance, we are nearer
to the secret mystery of life when we feel, with
Francis and with Loti, the common soul which binds
ourselves and them, than when we stand aloof from
them in a puffed-up and pompous vanity, or regard
them as the mere chattels and chores of a bondslave’s
service.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>SHELLEY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>Above my head in the starry July night goes
with soft, swift, silent movement through the
scented air, above the tall leaves of the aloes, and
under the green boughs of the acacias, a little brown
owl. Families of them live on the roof of this great
house, and at sunset they descend and begin hunting
for crickets and moths and water-beetles and mice.
These owls are called, in scientific nomenclature, the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>scops carniola</i></span>; to the peasantry they are known as
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>chiu</i></span>; by Shelley they were called the aziola. I
have never found any Italian who called this owl
aziola, but I suppose that Mary Godwin did, since
she said, ‘Do you not hear the aziola cry?’ And
Shelley made answer, very truly, of this cry, that it
was music heard,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘By wood and stream, meadow and mountain side,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fields and marshes wide,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such as nor voice, nor lute, nor wind, nor bird</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The soul ever stirred.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The note is very far-reaching, deep and sweet, clear
and melodious, one single note sounding at intervals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>of thirty or forty seconds through the still air of the
summer night. It is said to be a love call, but I
doubt it, for it may be heard long after the pairing
season; the bird gives it forth when he is flying as
when he is sitting still, and it is unmistakably a note
of contentment. Nor do I think it is sad, as Shelley
terms it; it has a sound as of pleased meditation in
it, and it has a mellow thrill which, once heard, cannot
be forgotten ever. For myself, never do I hear the
call of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>chiu</i></span> (which is often heard from May time
until autumn, when these birds migrate to the East)
without remembering Shelley and wishing that he
lived to hear.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is more truly a son of Italy than any one of
her own poets, for he had the sentiment and passion
of her natural beauty, which cannot be said of the
greatest of them. Neither he nor Byron can be well
comprehended by those who are not intimately
acquainted with Italian landscape. The exceeding
truthfulness of their observation of, and feeling for,
it cannot certainly be appreciated except by those
who have lived amongst the sights and sounds which
took so close a hold upon their imagination and
their heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron must have often ridden over the firm, smooth,
yellow shores of the sea beyond Pisa, for he lived
some time in the peaceful city dedicated to St
Ranier, and probably both he and Shelley spent many
hours many a time in a wood I know well, which
follows the line of the sea for sixteen miles, and is
many miles in depth. On the shore, pines, rooted
in drifted sand half a mile broad, stand between
the deciduous trees and the sea beach, and protect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>them from the violence of the westerly winds; when
you are half a mile inland, you leave the pines and
find ilex, acacia, beech, holly, juniper, and many
aspen and other forest trees. Here the wood-dove,
the goldfinch, the nuthatch, the woodpecker, the jay
and the cuckoo dwell; here the grassy paths lead
down dusky green aisles of foliage, fringed with
dog-roses, where one may roam at pleasure all the
day long, and meet nothing living beside the birds,
except sometimes a stoat or a fox; here the flag-lily
and the sword-rush grow in the reedy pools,
and the song of the nightingale may be heard in
perfection; its nests are made in numbers under
the bracken, amongst the gorse and in the impenetrable
thickets of the marucca and the heather.
These woods are still entirely wild and natural, and
they are rarely invaded except by the oxen or
buffaloes drawing waggons to be filled with cut
furze and dead branches by the rough and picturesque
families who sit aloft on the giddy heights of
these sylvan loads. But these invaders are few and
far between, and in spring and summer these forest
lands are as still and solitary as they certainly were
when the poets wandered through them, listening
to the sea-breeze sighing through the trees.</p>

<p class='c001'>No one, I repeat, can fully appreciate the fineness
and accuracy of observation and description of both
Byron and Shelley who does not know Italy well; not
with the pretended knowledge of the social hordes
who come to its cities for court, and embassy, and
gallery, and tea party, but such knowledge as can
alone be gained by long and familiar intimacy with
its remote and solitary places.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Few, perhaps, if any, think of Shelley as often as I
do; and to me his whole personality seems the most
spiritual and the most sympathetic of the age.</p>

<p class='c001'>The personality of Byron startles, captivates,
entrances; he flashes by us like a meteor; lover,
noble, man of pleasure and of the world, solitary and
soldier by turns, and a great poet always, let the
poetasters and sciolists of the moment say what they
will in their efforts to decry and to deny him.
Shelley’s has nothing of this dazzling and gorgeous
romance, as he has nothing in his portraits of that
haughty and fiery challenge which speaks in the pose
of the head and the glance of the eyes in every
picture of Byron. Shelley’s eyes gaze outward with
wistful, dreamy tenderness; they are the eyes of
contemplative genius, the eyes which behold that
which is not seen by the children of men. That
sweetness and spirituality which are in his physiognomy
characterise the fascination which his memory,
like his verse, must exercise over any who can understand
his soul. Nothing is more unfitting to him
than those wranglings over his remains which are
called studies of his life and letters. The solemnity
and beauty of his death and burial should surely
have secured him repose in his grave.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no other country than England would it be
possible to find writers and readers, so utterly
incapable of realising what manner of nature and
of mind his was, that they can presume to measure
both by their foot-rule of custom and try to press
both into their small pint-pot of conventional mortality.
Would he not have said of his biographers,
as he wrote of critics,—</p>

      <div class='line in14'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>‘Of your antipathy</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>What can his conduct, within the bonds of marriage
or without them, matter to a world which he blessed
and enriched? What can his personal sorrows or
failings be to people who should only rejoice to
hearken to his melodious voice? Who would not
give the lives of a hundred thousand ordinary women
to make happy for an hour such a singer as he?</p>

<p class='c001'>The greatest duty of a man of genius is to his own
genius, and he is not bound to dwell for a moment
in any circumstances or any atmosphere which injures,
restrains, or depresses it. The world has very little
comprehension of genius. In England there is, more
than anywhere else, the most fatal tendency to drag
genius down into the heavy shackles of common-place
existence, and to make Pegasus plough the common
fields of earth. English genius has suffered greatly
from the pressure of middle-class English opinion.
It made George Eliot a hypocrite; it made Tennyson
a chanter of Jubilee Odes; it put in chains
even the bold spirit of Browning; and it has kept
mute within the soul much noble verse which would
have had rapture and passion in its cadences. The
taint of hypocrisy, of Puritanism, of conventionality,
has deeply entered into the English character,
and how much and how great has been the loss it
has caused to literature none will ever be able to
measure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shelley affranchised himself in its despite, and for
so doing he suffered in his life and suffers in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>memory. He was a Republican in a time when
republican doctrines were associated with the horrors
of the guillotine and the excesses of the mob, then
fresh in the public mind. He would now be called
an Altruist where he was then called a Jacobin.
His exhortation to the men of England,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Men of England, wherefore plough</div>
      <div class='line'>For the lords who lay ye low?</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherefore weave with toil and care</div>
      <div class='line'>The rich robes your tyrants wear?’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>would, were it published now, be quoted with admiration
by all the good Radicals, with John Morley at
their head; indeed, it is astonishing that they have
never reprinted it in their manuals for the people.
It is wonderful also that ‘The Masque of Anarchy’
has escaped quotation by the leaders of the Irish
opposition, and that the lines written during the
Castlereagh administration have not been exhumed
to greet the administration of any Tory Viceroy.
Shelley in these forgot, as poets will forget, his own
law, that the poet, like the chameleon, should feed
from air, not earth. But what then was deemed so
terrible a political crime in one of his gentle birth
and culture would now be thought most generous
and becoming, as the democratic principles of Vernon
Harcourt and Lord Rosebery are now considered to
be by their political party; the odes and sonnets
which then drew down on him execration and persecution
would now procure him the gratitude of
Gladstone and the honour of the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A people starved and stabbed in the untillèd field,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>is a line which has been strangely overlooked by
orators for Ireland.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shelley’s political creed—if an impersonal but intense
indignation can deserve the name of creed—was
born of his hatred of tyranny and a pity for pain
which amounted to a passion. But his nature was
not one which could long nurture hate; and he says
truly that, with him and in all he wrote, ‘Love is
celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should
govern the moral world.’</p>

<p class='c001'>In politics, had he lived now, he would certainly
have fared much better; in moral liberty also he
would, I think, have found more freedom. Though
the old hypocrisy clings still in so much to English
society, in much it has been shaken off, and within
the last twenty years there has been a very marked
abandonment of conventional opinion. There is much
that is conventional still; much to the falsehood of
which it is still deemed necessary to adhere. But still
there is a greater liberality, a wider tolerance, an
easier indulgence; and it may certainly be said that
Shelley, if he lived now, would neither be worried to
dwell beside Harriet Westbrooke, nor would Mary
Godwin be excluded from any society worthy of the
name. Society is arriving at the consciousness that
for an ordinary woman to expect the monopoly of the
existence of a man of genius is a crime of vanity and
of egotism so enormous that it cannot be accepted in
its pretensions or imposed upon him in its tyranny.
Therefore it is wholly out of date, and unfitting to the
times, to see critics and authors discussing and embittering
the memory of Shelley on account of his
relations with women.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>These relations are in any man indisputably those
which most reveal his character; but they are none
the less indisputably those with which the public have
least permission to interfere. We have the ‘Prometheus
Unbound’ and ‘The Revolt of Islam’; we have
the sonnet to England and the ode to the skylark;
we have the <a id='corr261.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘Good-night'>‘Good-night’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_261.7'><ins class='correction' title='‘Good-night'>‘Good-night’</ins></a></span>; and the ‘Song’; and with
all these riches and their like given to us by his
bounteous and beautiful youth, shall we dare to rake
in the ashes of his funeral-pyre and search in the
faded lines of his letters to find material for carping
censure or for ingenious misconstruction? It adds
greater horror to death; this groping of the sextons
of the press amongst the dust of the tomb, this unhallowed’’
searching of alien hands amongst the papers
which were written only to be read by eyes beloved.
The common mortal is freed from such violation; he
has left nothing behind him worth the stealing, he has
been a decorous and safe creature, and his signature
has been affixed to his weekly accounts, his bank
drafts, his household orders, his epistles to his children
at school, and not a soul cares to disturb the dust on
their tied-up bundles. But the man or woman of
genius has no sepulchre buried so deep in earth or
barred so strongly that the vampire of curiosity cannot
enter to break in and steal; from Heloise to
Shelley the paper on which the burning words which
come straight from the heart are recorded is the
prey of the vulgar, and the soul bared only to
one other soul becomes the sport of those who
have not eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor mind to
understand.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said ere now often, and I shall say it as long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>as I have power to say anything, that with the private
life of the man or woman of genius the world has
nothing to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is it to the world who was Allegra’s mother,
or who was the prototype of Mignon, or who was the
Lady of Solitude of the Elysian isles of the ‘Epipsychidion’;
what matter whether Shakespeare blessed
or cursed Anne Hathaway, or whether personal pains
and longings inspired the doctrines of the ‘Tetrarchordon’?
It matters no more than it matters
whether Lesbia’s sparrow was a real bird or a metaphor,
no more than it matters whether the carmen to
Cerinthe were written for the poet’s pleadings <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in propria
persona</i></span> or for his friend. It matters nothing.
We have ‘Don Juan’ and ‘Wilhelm Meister’; we
have ‘Hamlet’ and the ‘Lycidas’; we have the songs
of Catullus and the elegies of Tibullus; what wants
the world more than these? Alas! alas! it wants
that which shall pull down the greater stature to the
lower; it wants that which shall console it for its own
drear dulness by showing it the red spots visible on
the lustre of the sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>The disease of ‘documents,’ as they are called in the
jargon of the time, is only another name for the insatiable
appetite to pry into the private life of those
greater than their fellows, in the hope to find something
therein wherewith to belittle them. Genius may say as
it will that nothing human is alien to it, humanity
always sullenly perceives that genius <em>is</em> genius precisely
because it is something other than humanity,
something beyond it, above it—never of it; something
which stands aloof from it, however it may express
itself as kin to it. That the soul of man is divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>is a doubtful postulate; but, that whatever there is
divine in a human form is to be found in genius, is
true for all time. The mass of men dimly feel this,
and they vaguely resent it, and dislike genius, as the
multitude in India and Palestine disliked Buddha
and Christ. When the tiger tears it or the cross
bears it the mass of men are consoled for their own
inferiority to it. In the world Prometheus is always
kept chained; and the fire he brings from heaven is
spat upon.</p>

      <div class='line'>Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew</div>
      <div class='line'>Down the steep west into a wondrous hue</div>
      <div class='line'>Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the swift sun yet paused in his descent</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the many-folded hills—they were</div>
      <div class='line'>These famous Euganean hills, which bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>As seen from Lido through the harbour piles,</div>
      <div class='line'>The likeness of a clump of peaked isles—</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, as if the earth and sea had been</div>
      <div class='line'>Dissolved into one lake of fire, were seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Those mountains towering, as from waves of flame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Around the vaporous sun, from which there came</div>

roseate Euganean hills, whilst the full moon hung
exactly opposite, over the more distant chain of the
Istrian mountains.</p>

      <div class='line'>Rude, but made sweet by distance;—and a bird</div>

</div>

<p class='c014'>He said, ‘which cannot be a nightingale,’ because he
wrote this on the 1st of July, and nightingales rarely
sing after June is past. But I have heard nightingales
sing in Italy until the middle of July if the
weather were cool and if their haunts, leafy and
shady, were well protected from the sun; so that this
bird which he heard was most likely Philomel.
Blackbirds and woodlarks sing late into the dark of
evening, but never in the actual night.</p>

      <div class='line'>Those spheres instinct with it become the same,</div>
      <div class='line'>Touch, mingle, are transfigured; ever still</div>
      <div class='line'>Burning, yet ever inconsumable:</div>
      <div class='line'>In one another’s substance finding food,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like flames too pure and bright and unimbued</div>
      <div class='line'>To nourish their bright lives with baser prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away:</div>
      <div class='line'>One hope within two wills, one will beneath</div>
      <div class='line'>Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,</div>
      <div class='line'>One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,</div>
      <div class='line'>And one annihilation. Woe is me!</div>
      <div class='line'>The winged words on which my soul would pierce</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the height of love’s rare Universe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are chains of lead around its flight of fire,—</div>
      <div class='line'>I pant, I sink, I tremble I expire!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>No words which were ever written ever expressed
more truly that infinite and indefinite yearning which
exists in all love that is a passion of the soul as well
as of the senses; that nameless longing for some still
closer union than any which physical and mental union
can bestow upon us; that desire for absolute absorption
into and extinction within the life beloved, as
stars are lost in the light of the sun, which never can
find full fruition in life as we know it here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Keats, Shelley, Savage Landor, Byron, Browning,
and Robert Lytton, have been each and all
profoundly penetrated by and deeply imbued with
the influence of Italy; and it may be said of each
and all of them that their genius has been at its
highest when under Italian influences, and has been
injured and checked and depressed in its development
by all English influences brought to bear upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Shelley most completely of all escapes the latter,
not only because he died so early, but because his
whole temperament resisted conventional pressure as
a climbing plant resists being fastened to the earth;
flung it off with impatience, as the shining plumage
of the sea-bird flings off the leaden-coloured rain and
the colourless sands of the shore. Shelley had not
only genius: he had courage; the most rare, most
noble, and most costly of all forms of courage, that
which rejects the measurements and the laws imposed
upon the common majority of men by conventional
opinion. And this praise, no slight praise, may be
given to him, which cannot be given to many, that he
had the courage to act up to his opinions. The world
had never dominion enough over him to make him
fear it, or sacrifice his higher affections to it. In this,
as in his adoration of Nature and his instinctive
pantheism, he was the truest poet the modern world
has known.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the multitude of men he must be forever
unintelligible and alien; because their laws are not
his laws, their sight is not his sight, their heaven of
small things makes his hell, and his heaven of beautiful
visions and of pure passions is a paradise whereof
they cannot even dimly see the portals. But to all
poets his memory and his verse must ever be inexpressibly
dear and sacred. His ‘Adonais’ may be
repeated for himself. There is a beauty in the
manner of his death which we must not grudge to
him if we truly love him. It fitly rounded a poet’s
life. That life was short, as measured by years! but,
ended so, it was more complete than it would have
been had it stretched on to age. Who knows?—he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>might have become a magnate in Hampshire, a
country squire, a member of Parliament, a sheriff for
the county, any and all things such as the muses
would have wept for; Shelley in England, Shelley
old, would have been Shelley no more. Better and
sweeter the waves of the Tyrrhene Sea and the violet-sown
grave of Rome. Sadder and more painful than
earliest death is it to witness the slow decay of the
soul under the carking fret and burdensome conventionalities
of the world; more cruel than the sudden
storm is the tedious monotony of the world’s bondage.
The sea was merciful when it took the Adonais who
sang of Adonais from earth when he was yet young.
He and his friends, he and those who wrote the
‘Endymion’ and the ‘Manfred,’ were happy in their
deaths; their spirits, eternally young, live with us and
have escaped all contamination of the commonplace.
Byron might have lived to wrangle in the Lords over
the Corn Laws; Keats might have lived to become
a London physician and pouch fees; Shelley might
have lived to be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Custos Rotulorum</i></span> and to take his
daughters to a court ball. Their best friend was the
angel of death who came at Rome, at Missolonghi, at
Lerici. ‘Whom the gods love die young.’</p>

<p class='c001'>The monotony, the thraldom and the pettiness of
conventional life lie forever in wait for the man of
genius, to sink him under their muddy waters and
wash him into likeness with the multitude: Shelley,
Byron and Keats escaped this fell embrace.</p>

<p class='c001'>What may be termed the material side of the intellect
receives assistance in England, that is to say,
in the aristocratic and political world of England;
wit and perception and knowledge of character are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>quickened and multiplied by it. But the brilliancy,
liberty and spirituality of the imagination are in it
dulled and lowered. If a poet can find fine and fair
thoughts in the atmosphere of a London Square, he
would be visited by far finer and fairer thoughts were
he standing by the edge of the Adrian or Tyrrhene
Sea, or looking down, eagle-like, from some high
spur of wind-vexed Apennine. The poet should
not perhaps live forever away from the world, but
he should oftentimes do so.</p>

<p class='c001'>The atmosphere of Italy has been the greatest
fertiliser of English poetical genius. There is something
fatal to genius in modern English life; its
conditions are oppressive; its air is heavy; its habits
are altogether opposed to the life of the imagination.
Out-of-door life in England is only associated with
what is called ‘the pleasure of killing things,’ and is
only possible to those who are very robust of frame
and hard of feeling. The intellectual life in England
is only developed in gaslight and lamplight, over
dinner-tables and in club-rooms, and although the
country houses in some instances might be made
centres of intellectual life, they never are so by any
chance, and remain only the sanctuaries of fashion, of
<a id='corr274.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='gastromony'>gastronomy</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_274.25'><ins class='correction' title='gastromony'>gastronomy</ins></a></span> and of sport. The innumerable demands
on time, the routine of social engagements, the
pressure of conventional opinion, are all too strong
in England to allow the man of genius to be happy
there, or to reach there his highest and best development.
The many artificial restraints of life in
England are, of all things, the most injurious to the
poetic temperament, which at all times is quickly
irritated and easily depressed by its surroundings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>There is not enough leisure or space for meditation,
or freedom to live as the affections or the fancy or
the mind desires; and the absence of beauty—of
beauty, artistic, architectural, natural and physical—oppresses
and dulls the poetic imagination without its
being sensible of what it is from the lack of which
it suffers.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been said of a living statesman that he
is only great in opposition. So may it be said of
the poet who touches mundane things. He is only
great in opposition. Milton could not have written
a Jubilee Ode without falling from his high estate;
and none can care for Shakespeare without desiring
to expunge the panegyric on a Virgin Queen written
for the Masque of Kenilworth. The poet is lord of a
spiritual power; he is far above the holders of powers
temporal. He holds the sensitive plant in his hand,
and feels every innermost thrill of Nature; he is false
to himself when he denies Nature and does a forced
and unreal homage to the decrees and the dominion
of ordinary society or of ordinary government.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Both are alien to him, and are his foes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This line might fittingly have been graven on
Shelley’s tombstone, for it was essentially the law
of his soul. The violence of his political imprecations
is begotten by love, though love of another
kind: love of justice, of truth, of tolerance, of liberty,
all of which he beheld violated by the ruling powers
of the state and of the law. With the unerring vision
which is the birthright of genius, he saw through the
hypocrisies and shams of kings, and priests, and
churches, and council-chambers, and conventional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>morality, and political creeds. The thunder of the
superb sonnet to England which begins with the
famous line,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘An old, mad, blind, despised and dying king,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>came from his heart’s depths in scorn of lies, in
hatred of pretence, in righteous indignation as a
patriot at the corruption, venality and hypocrisy of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Rulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know,</div>
      <div class='line'>But leech-like to their fainting country cling.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It is perhaps to be lamented that the true poetic
temperament should ever turn aside to share the
fret and fever of political strife. It is waste of the
spirit of Alastor to rage against Swellfoot. But the
poet cannot wholly escape the influences of baser
humanity, and, watching the struggles of ‘the blind
and battling multitude’ from afar, he cannot avoid
being moved either to a passion of pity or to a
passion of disdain, or to both at once, in view of
this combat, which seems to him so poor and
small, so low and vile. Men of genius know the
mere transitory character of those religions and
those social laws which awe, as by a phantasm of
terror, weaker minds, and they refuse to allow their
lives to be dictated to or bound down; and in
exact proportion to their power of revolt is their
attainment of greatness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soul of Shelley was, besides, deeply imbued
by that wide pantheism which makes all the received
religions of men look so trite, so poor, so narrow and
so mean.</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern life gives you six electric bells beside your
bed, but not one court or chamber that a great artist
would care to copy. The poet yawning among the
electric bells becomes a common-place person, with a
mind obscured by a gourmet’s love of the table and
the cellar; he is the chameleon who has lost his
luminous and magical powers of transfiguration, and
become a mere gorged lizard stuffed with sugar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, were in their different
lives so great because they had all the power to reject
the drowsy and dulling influences of the common
world of men, and withdraw from it to Ravenna, to
Lirici, to Rydal. The commonplace of life, whether
in occupations, relationships, or so-called duties, eats
away the poetry of temperament with the slow, sure
gnawing of the hidden insect which eats away the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>tiger-skin until where the golden bronze and deep
sable of the shining fur once glistened, there is only
a bald, bare spot, with neither colour nor beauty left
in it. There are millions on millions of ordinary
human lives to follow the common tracks and fulfil
the common functions of human life. When the poet
is dragged down to any of these he is lost. The moth
who descried the star lies dead in the kitchen fire,
degraded and injured beyond recall.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>Sir Lyon, <em>now</em> Lord, Playfair, read to the
assembled members of the British Association,
when they met at Aberdeen, a discourse both eloquent
and well suited to excite the enthusiasm of
his audience, already disposed by taste and bias to
salute its propositions as gospel. That there were
truths in it, no one would dispute; that it was
exclusively composed of truth is not so evident to
minds unswayed by scientific prejudice. It, at all
events, was a curious and complete example of the
scientific mind, of its views, conclusions and expectations,
and is therefore interesting in itself, if not
as overwhelming in its persuasions to the dispassionate
reader as it was to the sympathetic and
selected audience to which it was addressed. Scientific
persons usually never address themselves to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>any other audience than one thus pannelled and
prepared. They like to see a crowd of their own
disciples in their halls ere they let fall their pearls
of wisdom. The novelist does not demand that
he shall be only read by novelists. The painter
does not think that none but painters can be
permitted to judge a painting. The sculptor does
not ask that every critic of his work shall be a
Phidias. The historian does not insist that none
but a Tacitus shall pass judgment on him. But the
scientist does exact that no opinion shall be formed
of him and of his works except by his own brethren,
and sweeps aside all independent criticism on a
principle which, if carried out into other matters,
would forbid John Ruskin ever to give an opinion on
painting, and would prohibit Francisque Sareey from
making any critical observations on actors. This
address satisfied its audience, because that audience
was composed of persons already willing to be
satisfied; but if we can imagine some listener altogether
without such bias, if we can suppose some
one amongst the auditors with mind altogether unprejudiced,
such an one might without effort have
found many weak places in this fine discourse, and
would have been sorely tempted to cry ‘Question!
Question!’ at more than one point in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taken as a whole, the address was an admirable
piece of special pleading in favour of science, and of
her superior claims upon the resources of all states
and the minds of all men. But special pleading has
always this disadvantage: that it seeks to prove too
much; and the special pleading of the President of
the Aberdeen meeting is not free from this defect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>We know, of course, that, in his position, he could
hardly say less; that with his antecedents and
reputation, he would not have wished to say less;
but those who are removed from the spell of his eloquence,
and peruse his arguments in the serene air
of their studies, may be pardoned if they be more
critical than an audience of fellow-workers, and
mutual admirers, if they lay down the pages of his
admirably-worded praises of science, and ask themselves
dispassionately: How much of this is true?</p>

<p class='c001'>The main object of the discourse was to prove that
science is the great benefactress of the world. But
is it proved? To the mind of the scientist the doubt
will seem as impious as the doubt of the sceptic
always does seem to the true believer. Yet it is a
doubt which must be entertained by those who are
not led away by that bigotry of science, which has
so much and so grievously in common with the
bigotry of religions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us see what are the statements which the
President of the British Association brings forward
in support of the position which he gives to Science
as the goddess and the benefactress of mankind.
First, to do this he casts down the Humanities
beneath his feet, as the professors of science always
do; and, as an illustration of the uselessness which
he assigns to them, he asserts that were a Chrysoloras
to teach Greek in the Italian universities he would
not hasten perceptibly the onward march of Italy!</p>

<p class='c001'>What does this mean? It is a statement, but the
statement of an opinion, not of a fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is comprised under the vague term ‘the
onward march of Italy?’ Does it mean the return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>of Italy to her pristine excellence in all arts, her love
of learning, her grace of living? or does it mean the
effort of Italy to aggrandise herself at all cost, and
to engage in foreign and colonial wars whilst her
cities groan under taxation and her peasantry perish
of pellagra? In the one case the teaching of Chrysoloras
would be of infinite value; in the other
it would, no doubt, not harmonise with the vulgar
greeds and dangerous ambitions of the hour. If
the ‘onward march of Italy’ means that she is to
kneel to a Crispi, submit to a standing army, wait
slavishly on Germany, and scramble for the sands of
Africa, the teachings of Chrysoloras would be wasted;
but if it mean that she is to husband her strength,
cultivate her fertile fields, merit her gift of beauty,
and hold a high place in the true civilisation of the
world, then I beg leave to submit that Chrysoloras,
or what his name is here taken to symbolise, would
do more for her than any other teacher she could
have, certainly more than any teacher she now
possesses. Could the classic knowledge and all
which is begotten by it of serenity, grace, trained
eloquence and dispassionate meditation, be diffused
once more through the mind of Italian youth, it
would, I think, produce a generation which would
not applaud Eritrea and Kassala, nor accept the political
tyrannies of state-appointed prefects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scientists take for granted that the education
of the schools creates intelligence; very often it does
no such thing. It creates a superficial appearance
of knowledge, indeed; but knowledge is like food, unless
it be thoroughly assimilated when absorbed, and
thoroughly digested, it can give no nourishment; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>lies useless, a heavy and unleavened mass. It is the
fashion in these times to despise husbandmen and
husbandry, but it is much to be questioned if the city
cad, with his smattering of education, his dabbling in
politics, his crude, conceited opinions upon matters on
which he is absolutely ignorant, be not a far more
ignorant, as he is undoubtedly a far more useless,
person than the peasant, who may never have opened
a book or heard of arithmetic, but thoroughly understands
the soil he works on, the signs of the weather,
the rearing of plants and of animals, and the fruits
of the earth which he cultivates. The man of genius
may be many-sided; nature has given him the power
to be so; but the mass of men do not and cannot
obtain this Protean power; to do one thing well is
the utmost that the vast majority can well hope to
do; many never do so much, nor a quarter so much.
To this vast majority science would say: you may be
as indifferent weavers, ploughmen, carpenters, shopmen,
what you will, but you must know where the spermatic
nerves are situated in the ichneumon, and you
must describe the difference between microzoaires and
miraphytes, and you must understand the solidification
of nitric acid. Nor is the temper which science and
its teachers seem likely thus to give the human race,
one of fair promise. How much have not the men of
science added to the popular dread of cholera, which
in its manifestation of cowardice and selfishness has
so grossly disgraced the Continent of Europe of late
years? Their real or imaginary creation, the microbe,
has invested cholera with a fanciful horror so new
and hideous in the popular mind, that popular terror
of it grows ungovernable, and will, in great likelihood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>revolt beyond all restraint, municipal or imperial,
whenever the disease shall again revisit Europe with
violence. Again, how many nervous illnesses, how
many imaginary diseases, have sprung into existence
since science, popularised, attracted the attention of
mankind to the mechanism of its own construction?
It is a familiar truth that a little knowledge is a
dangerous thing, and of no knowledge is it truer than
of physiological knowledge. It has been said, that
every one at forty should be a fool or a physician, and
so far as knowing what to eat, drink and avoid, every
one should be so; but, unhappily, those who become
the latter, <i>i.e.</i>, those who become capable of controlling
their own constitutional ailments and weaknesses,
are apt to contract in their study of themselves an
overweening tendency to think about themselves.
The generalisation of physiology amongst the masses
means the generalisation of this form of egotism. A
child who was told and shown something of anatomy,
said, naively: ‘Oh, dear me! now that I know how
I am made, I shall be always thinking that I am
coming to pieces.’ In a less innocent way the effect
of the popularisation of physiology is the same on
the multitude as on this child: it increases valetudinarianism,
nervousness and the diseases which spring
from morbid fears and morbid desires. Those nervous
illnesses which are the peculiar privilege of
modern times, are largely due to the exaggerated
attention to themselves which science has taught to
humankind. The Greek and the Latin said: ‘Let
us eat and drink and enjoy, for to-morrow we die.’
Modern science says: ‘Let us concentrate our whole
mind on ourselves and our body, although our mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>like our body is only a conglomeration of gases
which will go out in the dark.’ The classic injunction
and conclusion are the more healthy and the more
logical, and produced a race of men more manly,
more vigorous and more consistent with themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return to the assertions contained in this address
which we now consider: in the address it is stated
as a fact which all must rejoice over, that in Boston
one shoe factory, by its machines, does the work
of 30,000 shoemakers in Paris, who have still to go
through the weary drudgery of hand-labour. Now,
why is the ‘drudgery’ of sewing a shoe in any way
more ‘weary’ than the drudgery of oiling, feeding
and attending to a machine? Machine-work is, on
the contrary, of all work the most mechanical, the
most absolute drudgery. There is no kind of proof
that, because the work of 30,000 shoemakers is done
by a machine, mankind at large is any the happier
for this. We know that all machine-made work is
inferior to hand-work; inferior in durability, in
excellence of quality, and in its inevitable lack of
that kind of individuality and originality which handwork
takes from the fingers which form it. In the
<cite>Seven Lamps of Architecture</cite>, there is an admirable
exposition of this immeasurable difference in quality
which characterises hand-labour and machine-made
work; of the stone cut by steam and the stone cut
by hand. Let us only consider what ruin to the
arts of India has been brought about by the introduction
of machinery. The exquisite beauty of
Oriental work is due to the individuality which is
put into it; the worker, sitting beneath his grove of
date-trees, puts original feeling, individual character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>into each line graven on the metal, each thread
woven in the woof, each turn given to the ivory.
Machines destroy all this. They make machines of
the men who tend them, and give a soulless and
hateful monotony to everything which they produce.</p>

<p class='c001'>Despite the vaunt of Playfair, the cobbler who
sits on the village green, doing sound, if simple
work, honestly, giving a personality to the shoe he
labours on, and knowing on what foot it will be
worn and whither it will go, is a man, and maybe in
his own humble way a good artist; but the attendant
who feeds the shoe-machine with oil, or takes from
it its thousands of machine-cut leathers, is no better
than a machine himself; so far from being ‘set free,’
he is in servitude. The cobbler on the village green
knows far more of freedom than he.</p>

<p class='c001'>This curious statement that hand-work, with its scope
for originality and individual interest is slavery, whilst
the work of factories, mechanical, monotonous and
done in ugly chambers and unwholesome air, is liberty,
is surely the oddest delusion with which the fanatical
and biased mind of science ever delighted itself. Who
can compare the freedom of the native child in a village
of Benares, shaping an ebony or cocoanut toy under
the palm-fronds of his home, with the green paroquets
swinging, and the monkeys chattering in the sun-lit
bamboos above his head, with the servitude of the poor
little sickly and weary Hindoos, thronging in patient
flocks the noisome factory-chambers of Bombay?</p>

<p class='c001'>The President of the British Association seems to
expect that all men whom machines ‘set free’ from
the drudgery of their daily calling, will, all at once,
do something infinitely better than they did before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>they were free. But this seems to me a very rash
conclusion. If the 30,000 shoemakers are all ‘set
free’ in Paris, by the introduction of the Boston
machine, is it so certain that their freedom will produce
anything better than a good pair of shoes?
What greater freedom is there in attending to the
machine if they select to do that, or in entering
into another trade?—one thing or the other no doubt
they must do, if they want to earn their bread?
What have they gained by being ‘set free, and passed
from one kind of occupation to another?’ I fail to
see what they have gained. Have the public gained?
It is open to doubt. Where will be the gain to their
contemporaries, or to themselves, if these 30,000
shoemakers ‘set free’ become telegraph clerks or
book-keepers? Something they must become, unless
they are to live as paupers or mendicants. Where is
their freedom? ‘Set free’ is a seductive and resonant
expression, but analysed it simply means nothing
in this instance. And, before quitting this subject,
let me also remark that if Playfair knew as much
about shoes as he does about science, he would
know that a machine to make shoes is a most
unwholesome invention, because every shoe or boot
which is not made <em>expressly</em> for the foot which is to
wear it, is an ill-made shoe, and will cause suffering
and deformity to the unwise wearer. The vast mass
of the population of every ‘civilised’ nation has
deformed feet, because they buy and wear ready-made
shoes, thrusting their extremities into houses
of leather never designed for them. Machines which
make shoes by the thousand can only increase this
evil. As it is, we never see by any chance any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>walk well, unless it be some one whose shoes are
made with great care and skill, adjusted to his feet
alone, or peasants who have never shod their feet
at all and step out, with the bare sole set firmly and
lightly on their mother earth. Science can, no doubt,
turn out millions of cheap shoes, all exactly alike,
but Nature will not consent to adopt such monotony
of contour in the feet which will wear them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The President of the British Association speaks of
science always as of a Demeter, with blessings in
her hands, creating the fulness of the fields and the
joys of mankind. He forgets that the curse of
Demeter brought barrenness: and if we resist the
charm of his eloquence and look more closely at the
tissue of it, we shall not be so content to accept his
declarations. What does the expression mean, ‘to
benefit mankind?’ I conclude that it must mean to
increase its happiness and its health; all the wisdom of
the ages will avail it nothing if it pule in discontent and
fret in nervous sickness. Now, does science increase
the sum of human happiness? It is very doubtful.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us take the electric telegraph as an instance of
the benevolence of science. Can it be said to make
men happier? I think not. Politicians and diplomatists
agree that the hasty judgments and conflicting
orders which it favours and renders possible,
double the chances of internecine quarrels, and stimulate
to irritation and haste, which banish statesmanship.
In business the same defects are due to it, and
many a rash speculation or unconsidered reply, an
acceptance or refusal, forced on men without there
being time for any mature consideration, have led to
disastrous engagements and as disastrous failures.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Even in private life its conveniences may have a certain
value, but the many troubles and excitements
brought by it are incalculable. Niobe hearing of the
death of her children by a printed line on a yellow
sheet of paper, has her grief robbed of all dignity and
privacy, and intensified by a shock which deals her
its fatal blow without any preparation of the mind to
receive it. The telegraph, bridging space, may be,
and is, no doubt, a wonderful invention, but that
it has contributed to the happiness or wisdom of
humanity is not so certain. Men cannot do without
it now, no doubt; neither can they do without alcohol.
The telegraph, like nearly all the inventions of the
modern age, tends to shorten time but to harass it, to
make it possible to do much more in an hour, a day,
a year, than was done of old, but to make it impossible
to do any of this without agitation, brain-pressure
and hurry. It has impaired language and
manners, it has vulgarised death, and it has increased
the great evils of immature choice and hasty action;
these drawbacks weighed against its uses must at the
time prevent us from regarding its invention as an
unmixed blessing. Of the telephone may be said as
much, and more.<a id='rL' /><a href='#fL' class='c015'><sup>[L]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Playfair, proceeding in his enumeration of the benefits
which science confers on man, turns to that most
familiar matter, air, and that equally familiar element,
water. He speaks with pride of all which science has
discovered concerning their component parts, and their
uses and effects upon the world. His pride, no doubt,
may be justified in much, but he passes over one great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>fact in connection with air and water, <i>i.e.</i>, that both
have been polluted through the inventions of science
in a degree which may well be held to outweigh the
value of the discoveries of science.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were we to awake an Athenian of the time of
Phidias from his mausoleum, and take him with eyes
to see and ears to hear and nostrils to smell, into
Blackpool or Belfast, even into Zurich or Munich, he
would ask us, in stupefaction, under what curse of
the gods had the earth fallen that mankind should
dwell in such hideous clamour, such sooty darkness,
such foul stenches, such defiled and imprisoned air.
He would survey the begrimed toilers of the mills
and looms, the pallid women, the stunted offspring,
the long lines of hideous houses, the soil ankle-deep
with cinder-dust, the skies a pall of lurid smoke, the
country scorched and blackened and accursed; he
would survey all this, I say, asking by what malediction
of heaven and what madness of mankind the
sweetest and chief joys of Nature had been ruined
and forgotten thus? He would behold the dwarfed
trees dying under the fume of poisonous gases, the
clear river changed to a slimy, crawling, stinking,
putrid flood of filth; the buoyant air, once sweet as
the scent of cowslips or clover-grass, made by the
greed of man into a sickly, noxious, loathsome thing,
loaded with the stench of chemicals and the vapours
of engine-belched steam. He would stand amidst
this hell of discordant sounds, between these walls
of blackened brick, under this sky of heavy-hanging
soot; and he would remember the world as it was;
and if at his ears any prated of science, he would
smile in their faces, and say,—‘If these be the fruits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>of science let me rather dwell with the forest beast
and the untaught barbarian.’</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes; no doubt science can study air in her spectrum,
and analyse water in her retorts; she can tell
why the green tree dies in the evil gas, and the rose
will not bloom where the blast-furnace roars: she
can tell you the why and the wherefore, and can give
you a learned treatise on the calcined dust which
chokes up your lungs; but she cannot make the
green tree and the wild rose live in the hell she has
created for men, and she cannot make the skies she
has blackened lighter, nor the rivers she has poisoned
run clean. Even we who dwell where the air is pure,
and the southern sun lights the smiling waves and
the vine-clad hills, even we cannot tell how beautiful
was the earth in the days of the Greek anthologists;
when the silvery blue of wood-smoke alone rose from
the hearth fires; when the flame of the vegetable
oils alone illumined the fragrant night; when the
white sails alone skimmed the violet seas; when the
hand alone threw the shuttle and wove the web; and
when the vast virgin forests filled the unpolluted air
with their odorous breath. Even we cannot tell
what the radiance of the atmosphere, of the horizons,
of the sunrise and sunset, were when the world was
young. Our loss is terrible and hopeless, like the
loss of all youth. It may be useless to lament it,
but in God’s name let us not be such purblind fools
that we call our loss our gain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Repose, leisure, silence, peace and sleep are all
menaced and scattered by the inventions of the last
and present century. They are the greatest though
the simplest blessings that mankind has ever had;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>their banishment may be welcomed by men greedy
only of gold; but, meantime, the mad-houses are
crowded, spinal and cerebral diseases are in alarming
increase, heart-disease in divers shapes is general,
where it once was rare, and all the various forms
of bodily and mental paralysis multiply and crown
the triumphs of the age.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us turn for a moment to the consideration of
politics and of war as these are affected by the influence
of science. Playfair speaks much of the superior
wisdom, the superior education, the superior devotion
to science, of Germany, as contrasted with those of
any other nation; he lauds to the skies her enormous
grants to laboratories and professors of physiology
and chemistry and ‘original research’ (called by the
vulgar, vivisection); but the only result of all this
expenditure and instruction is a military despotism so
colossal that, whilst it overawes and paralyses both
German liberty and European peace, it yet may fall
over from its own weight any day, like the giant of
clay which it resembles. Are we not then justified in
objecting to accept, whilst the chief issue of German
culture is Militarism and anti-Semitism, such praises of
Germany, and refusing to render such homage to her?
‘By your fruits ye shall be judged,’ is a just saying:
and the fruits of Germany, in the concert of Europe
and the sum of political life, are dissension, apprehension,
absolutism, and the sacrifice of all other nations
to the pressure of the military Juggernaut which rolls
before her; whilst in her own national life the outcome
of the sanguinary lessons given by the government is
little better than the barbarism of the middle ages without
its redeeming law of chivalry. The incessant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>senseless duels which maim and disfigure German
youth remain a disgrace to civilisation, and a duellist
may fire three times at an adversary who <em>never returns
the fire</em> and, killing him at the last, will only be
punished by a slight imprisonment, whilst he will be
admired and deified by his comrades.<a id='rM' /><a href='#fM' class='c015'><sup>[M]</sup></a> Such barbarous
brutality, such insensibility to generous feeling,
such universal resort to the arbitration of every trifling
dispute by the pistol or the sabre, is the chief characteristic
of the nation in which science rules supreme!
Conscription, that curse of nations, is forced on all
weaklier powers by the enormous armed forces of
Germany; art suffers, trades suffer, families suffer;
and we are called on by a ‘scientific’ mind to admire
as a model the nation which is the cause of this suffering,
as we are bidden to admire as models also
her mutilated and bandaged students, and her blue-spectacled
and blear-eyed school children!</p>

<p class='c001'>Again Playfair traces the defeat of France in 1870
to the inferiority of her university teaching, and gives
the opinion of the Institut de France as his authority.
It seems a singularly illogical and unphilosophical
decision for such an august body to have given forth
publicly. The causes of the defeat of France stretch
farther back and have deeper roots than can be
accounted for by the omission of the state to create
more professors and laboratories. The whole teachings
of history show that all states, after reaching
their perihelion, gradually decline and sink into an
inferior place amongst the nations. The day of
France, as of England, is already past its noon.
Neither will ever be what they have been. Neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>will ever again give law to Europe as they gave it
once. But so many causes, some near, some remote,
have all contributed to bring about a decline which
is as inevitable to nations as to individuals, that it
is surely most unphilosophic to contend that such
decay could have been averted by the creation of some
hundred or thousand more professors of natural or
other science. It may be excusable for such a professor
to consider such professorships the one universal
panacea for all ills; but it is not an opinion in which
those who know France best and most intimately
would be inclined to coincide. They would conclude
that, on the contrary, she has too many professors
already; that the grace, and wit, and courtesy, and
wisdom and chivalry have gone out of her since she
was ruled from the desks of the school-master, the
physiologist and the notary, and that the whole
system of French colleges is calculated to emasculate
and injure the character of the schoolboy before he
goes up for his baccalaureate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The German invasion of France was supported by
all which science could do, yet most military judges
are agreed that unless the carelessness of her foe had
afforded her a fortnight’s preparation, Germany would
have been hopelessly beaten on her own territory;
whilst, look at the campaign how we may, it cannot
stand a moment’s comparison with the Eastern
marches of Alexander, or the conquests of Roman
generals. With none of the resources of modern
warfare, these great conquerors carried fire and sword
through the whole of the regions known to them,
from the sands of Africa to the ice-plains of the Baltic.
What is there in modern war, which can compare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>with the campaigns of Hannibal, the amazing victories
of Julius Cæsar, the deeds of the young Pompeiins,
the story of every Legion? In the English endeavour
to rescue Gordon, with every aid which
modern science can invent, and assisted by every
facility which modern modes of transit lend to the
transport of multitudes, an army was despatched from
Great Britain with orders to reach a city on the Nile.
The errand was too difficult to be accomplished; the
generals returned with their mission unfulfilled; the
country received them with honour. This is the
height to which the assistance of modern science has
brought the would-be Cæsars of the age.</p>

<p class='c001'>What child’s play would this expedition to Khartoum
have seemed to Scipio Africanus or to Lucius
Sylla! Yet all the ‘resources of science’ did not
save the modern expedition from failure, and, in the
face of Europe and Asia, it retreated in ignominy
before the barbaric and untrained followers of a half-mad
prophet, after an enormous expenditure of stores
and treasure, and a perfectly useless waste of human
life!</p>

<p class='c001'>War has been almost incessant since the empire
of science, but it has been characterised neither by
magnanimity nor true triumph. Europe, armed to
the teeth, is like a muzzled pack of blood-hounds;
every nation lives in terror of the others; to such a
pass has scientific warfare brought the world. The
multiplication of engines of destruction is one of the
chief occupations and boasts of a scientific age, and
it can claim a melancholy pre-eminence in the discovery
of the means to inflict the most agonising of
all wounds through the medium of conical bullets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and shells of nitro-glycerine. To have added unspeakable
horror to death, and to have placed the
power of secret and wholesale assassination in the
hands of ignorant and envious men, is one of the
chief benefits which this Egeria has brought to her
eager pupil. And when her worshippers laud her
to the skies, as does the president of the Aberdeen
meeting, their silence on this side of her teaching is
at once significant and ominous.</p>

<p class='c001'>Playfair is obviously afraid that the Humanities
will always obtain, in England at least, a larger place
in public teaching and in public subsidies than pure
science will be able to do. I wish his fear may be
justified. My own fears are on the other side.
Science offers prizes to the prurient curiosities and
the nascent cruelties of youth with which literature
can never compete. To study all the mysteries of
sex in anatomy, and to indulge the power of a Nero
in little when watching the agonies of a scientifically-tortured
or poisoned dog, are enjoyments appealing
to instincts in the frame of the school-boy, with which
not even the most indecent passage in his Greek or
Latin authors can ever pretend to measure attraction.
The professors of science need have no fear as to the
potency of the charm which their curriculum will
exercise over the juvenile mind. Teaching which
offers at once the penetration into corporeal secrets
and the power of torture over animals, possesses a
fascination for the minds of youth which it will never
lose, because its appeals are addressed to those
coarsest and crudest impulses which are strongest of
all in the child and in the adolescent.</p>

<p class='c001'>What science is preparing for the future of man, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>thus putting the scalpel and the injecting-needle into
the hands of children, is a darker and wider question.
One thing is certain, that in the future, as in the
streets and temples of Ancient Rome, there will be
no altar to Pity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The acknowledged doctrine of the professors of
‘research,’ that all knowledge is valuable because it
is, or appears to be, knowledge, and that all ways and
methods of obtaining it are justified and sanctified,
bears so curious a likeness to the self-worship of the
Papal dominion and of the Spanish Inquisition, that
we see, with a sense of despair, how bigotry and
despotism in some form or another are fated to
reappear so long as human life shall last.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is significant of the political immorality and
readiness to tyrannise over others in the pursuit of
their aims, which characterise the scientific classes,
that they are willing to admire and support any
government, however despotic, which is willing in
return to endow their scholarships and erect their
laboratories. They are inclined to surrender all
political liberty, if by so doing they can obtain a
ruler who will build them a number of new colleges,
with every new instrument ready to their hands
for animal torture and physiological or chemical
experiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>A Lorenzo di Medici, devoted exclusively to the
sciences instead of to the arts, would be their ideal
sovereign. Public liberties might perish under him
as they should; he would give science her free scope,
her desired endowments, her million living victims;
he would be even too enlightened to refuse her
human subjects for the physiological laboratory.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>This curious willingness of the pursuers of science
to join hands with tyranny, so long as tyranny helps
themselves, is the darkest menace of the world’s
future. In time to come it may assume dimensions
and aspects which are undreamed of now. The
demand of biologists and chemists to be provided
for out of the funds of the state, is a demand
which has never been made by literature or art,
and would not be tolerated from them. The exorbitant
sums insisted on for the establishment of
laboratories and professorships, rob science of that
character of disinterested devotion which alone would
make it worthy of esteem. ‘Give me a thousand or
fifteen hundred a year,’ says the physiologist to the
state; ‘give me money-grants also for experiments
which I may spend at my good option and for which
I need return no account, and leave me to cut up
dogs and cats and horses at leisure. In return I
will give you some new facts about internal hydrocephalus
or the length of time a new poison takes
to kill a guinea-pig.’ The agreement may, or may
not, be worth the state’s entering into with the
physiologist, but in any case the physiologist cannot
deny that he makes a good income out of his science,
and cannot pretend to any disinterested or philanthropic
selection of it. The moment that any man
accepts a salary for intellectual work, he must submit
to resign all claim to purely intellectual devotion to
it. The claims of scientists to be paid and provided
for out of national funds has many equivocal aspects,
and will have many unwholesome results; whilst the
rapacity and insistence with which they are put forward
are as unbecoming as they are undisguised.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>The high priests of modern science are not likely
to shed tears like the Greek philosopher Isocrates
because they are compelled to take money. On the
contrary, they clamour loudly for their maintenance
by their nation, with a cupidity which has happily
never disgraced either literature or art.</p>

<p class='c001'>As modern socialism aspires to make the world
into one vast allotment-ground, with every man’s
half-acre meted out to him on which to build his
hut and hive his store, so science would change the
world into one vast class-room and laboratory, wherein
all humanity (paying very large fees) should sit at
the feet of its professors, whom it would clothe with
purple and fine linen, and whom it would never presume
to oppose or to contradict.</p>

<p class='c001'>The world will gain nothing by delivering itself, as
it is gradually doing, from the bondage of the various
churches and their priesthoods, if in their stead it puts
its neck under the yoke of a despotism, more intellectual
perhaps, but as bigoted, as arrogant, and as
cruel. That this danger lies before it from its submission
to the demands of science, no dispassionate
student of humanity can doubt.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>FEMALE SUFFRAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>It is a singular fact that England, which has been
always esteemed the safest and slowest of all
factors in European politics, should be now seriously
meditating on such a revolutionary course of action
as the political emancipation of women. It is a sign,
and a very ominous sign, of the restlessness and
feverishness which have come upon this century in
its last twenty years of life, and from which England
is suffering no less than other nations, is perhaps
even suffering more than they, since when aged
people take the diseases natural to youth it fares
ill with them, more ill than with the young. There
are many evidences that before very long, whichever
political party may be in office, female suffrage
will be awarded at <a id='corr300.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Westminister'>Westminster</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_300.16'><ins class='correction' title='Westminister'>Westminster</ins></a></span>, and if it be so, it
is scarcely to be doubted that the French Chambers
and the Representative Houses at Washington will
be loth to lag behind and resist such a precedent.
The influence on the world will scarcely be other
than most injurious to its prosperity and most
degrading to its wisdom.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>It is true that the wholesale exercise of electoral
rights by millions of uneducated and unwashed
men is a spectacle so absurd that a little more or a
little less absurdity may be held not to matter very
greatly. The intellectual world in political matters
has voluntarily abdicated already and given its
sceptre to the mob. ‘Think you,’ said Publius
Scipio to the raging populace, ‘then, I shall fear
those free whom I sent in chains to the slave
market?’ But the modern politician, of whatever
nation he be (with the solitary exception of Bismarck),
does fear the slaves whose chains he has
struck off before they know how to use their liberty,
and has in him neither the candour nor the courage
of Scipio.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rationally, logically, political power ought to be
alloted in proportion to the stake which each voter
possesses in the country. But this sound principle
has been totally disregarded in the present political
systems of both Europe and America. Vapourings
anent the inherent ‘rights of man’ have been allowed
to oust out common-sense and logical action, and he
whose contributions to the financial and intellectual
power of his nation are of the largest and noblest
order has no more electoral voice in the direction
of the nation than the drunken navvy or the howling
unit of the street-mob. This is esteemed liberty, and
commends itself to the populace, because it levels, or
seems to level, intellect and wealth with poverty and
ignorance. It is probable that America will, in years
to come, be the first to change this, the doctrine of
democracy, as there are signs that the United States
will probably grow less and less democratic with every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>century, and its large land-owners will create an aristocracy
which will not be tolerant of the dominion of
the mob. But meantime Europe is swaying between
absolutism and anarchy, with that tendency of the
pendulum to swing wildly from one extreme to the
other which has been always seen in the whole
history of the world; and one of the most curious
facts of the epoch is that both democracy and conservatism
are inclined to support and promote female
suffrage, alleging each of them totally different motives
for their conduct, and totally different reasons
for the opinions which they advance in its favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>The motives of the Tory leaders are as unlike those
of Mrs Fawcett, Mrs Garratt, and the rest of the
female agitators as stone is unlike water, as water is
unlike fire. The conservative gentlemen wish to
admit women into political life because they consider
that women are always religious, stationary, and
wedded to ancient and stable ways; the female
agitators, on the contrary, clamour to have themselves
and their sex admitted within the political
arena because they believe that women will be foremost
in all emancipation, innovation, and social
democratic works. It is an odd contradiction, and
displays perhaps more than anything else the utter
confusion and the entire recklessness and abandonment
of principle characteristic of all political parties
in the latter half of the nineteenth century. It is
very possible that as the English labourer obtained
his vote through the confusion and jealousies of
party against the sane, the serene, and the unbiased
judgment of patriots, so woman in England, and if
in England, ultimately in America, will obtain hers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Opportunist policies have always their sure issue in
sensational and hurried legislation; and in Europe
at the present hour, in England and France most
especially, an opportunist policy is the only policy
pursued.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is there to be said in favour of female
suffrage? It may be treated as an open subject,
since both Reactionists and Socialists can advance
for it claims and arguments of the most totally
opposite nature. Perhaps it may be said that
there is some truth in both sides of these arguments
and entire truth in neither. It is probable
that female politicians would be many of them
more reactionary than the Reactionists, and many
of them would be more socialistic than the Socialists.
The golden mean is not in favour with women or
with mobs.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England, both the Conservative and Radical
intentions are at present limited to giving the suffrage
to such women alone as are possessed of real
property. But it is certain that this limitation could
not be preserved; for the women without property
would clamour to be admitted, and would succeed
by their clamour as the men without property have
done. No doubt, to see a woman of superior mind
and character, capable of possessing and administering
a great estate, left without electoral voice, whilst
her carter, her porter, or the most illiterate labourer
on her estate possesses and can exercise it, is on the
face of it absurd. But it is not more absurd than
that her brother should have his single vote outnumbered
and neutralised by the votes of the men-servants,
scullions and serving-boys who take his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>wage and fill his servants’ hall and kitchen. It would
be more honest to say that the whole existing system
of electoral power all over the world is absurd; and
will remain so, because in no nation is there the
courage, perhaps in no nation is there the intellectual
power, capable of putting forward and sustaining
the logical doctrine of the <em>just supremacy of the
fittest</em>: a doctrine which it is surely more vitally
necessary to insist on in a republic than in a monarchy.
It is because the fittest have not had the
courage to resist the pressure of those who are intellectually
their inferiors, and whose only strength lies
in numbers, that democracy has been enabled to
become the power that it has. Theoretically, a
republic is founded on the doctrine of the supremacy
of the fittest; but who can say that since the days
of Perikles any republic has carried out this doctrine
practically? The lawyer or the chemist who neglects
his business to push himself to the front in political
life in France is certainly not the most admirable
product of the French intellect; nor can it be said
by any impartial student that every President of the
United States has been the highest type of humanity
that the United States can produce.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alexander Dumas <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fils</i></span>, the most accomplished, but
the most rabid of the advocates of female suffrage,
resumes what seems to him the absurdity of the
whole system in a sentence. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Mme. de Sévigné ne
peut pas voter; M. Paul son jardinier peut voter.’</span>
He does not seem to see that there is as great an
absurdity in the fact that were Mme. de Sévigné,
Monsieur de Sévigné, and were she living now, all
her wit and wisdom would fail to confer on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>more voting power than would be possessed by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Paul
son jardinier.’</span></p>

<p class='c001'>With all deference to him, I do not think that
Mme. de Sévigné would have cared a straw to rival
Paul, the gardener, in going to the electoral urn.
Mme. de Sévigné, like every woman of wit and mind,
had means of exercising her influence so incomparably
superior to the paltry one of recording a vote
in a herd that she would, I am sure, have had the
most profound contempt for the latter. Indeed, her
contempt would have probably extended to the whole
electoral system and ‘government by representation.’
Women of wit and genius must always be indifferent
to the opportunity of going up to the ballot booth
in company with their own footman and coachman.
To those who have a sense of humour the position is
not one of dignity. Hypatia, when she feels herself
the equal of Julian, will not readily admit that Dadus,
however affranchised, is her equal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Absurdities are not cured by adding greater absurdities
to them; discrepancies are not remedied
by greater discrepancies being united to them.
Whether women voted or not would not change by
a hair’s breadth the existing, and to many thinkers
the deplorable fact, that under the present electoral
system throughout the world, the sage has no more
electoral power than the dunce, that Plato’s voice
counts for no more than a fool’s. The admission of
women could do nothing to remedy this evil. It
would only bring into the science of politics what it
has too much of already—inferior intelligence and
hysterical action. No: reply both the French
essayist and the conservative advocates of female
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>suffrage. Not so; because we should only admit
women qualified to use it by the possession of property.
But it would be impossible to sustain this
limitation in the teeth of all the levelling tendencies
of modern legislation; it would speedily be declared
unjust, intolerable, aristocratic, iniquitous, and it
would soon become impossible to deny to Demos’s
wife or mistress, mother or sister, what you award to
Demos himself. If women be admitted at all to the
exercise of the franchise they must be admitted
wholesale down to the lowest dregs of humanity as
men are now admitted. The apple-woman will
naturally argue that she has as much right to it as
the heiress; how can you say she has not when you
have given the apple-man as much electoral voice as
the scholar? It is idle to talk of awarding the female
suffrage on any basis of property when property
has been deliberately rejected as a basis for male
suffrage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The project often insisted on by the advocates of
the system, to give votes only to unmarried women,
may be dismissed without discussion, as it would be
found to be wholly untenable. It would give votes
to the old maids of Cranford village, and the enriched
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cocottes</i></span> of great cities, and would deny them to a
Mme. Roland or a Mme. de Staël, to Lady Burdett
Coutts or to Mme. Adam. The impossibility of any
such limitation being sustained if female suffrage be
ever granted, renders it unnecessary to dwell longer
on its self-evident defects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, are women prepared to purchase electoral
rights by their willingness to fulfil military obligations?
If not, how can they expect political privileges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>unless they are prepared to renounce for them
the peculiar privileges which have been awarded to
them in view of the physical weakness of their sex?
Dumas does, indeed, distinctly refuse to let them be
soldiers, on the plea that they are better occupied
in child-bearing, but in the same moment he asserts
that they ought to be judges and civil servants. It
is difficult to see why to postpone an assault to
a beleaguered city because <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Mme. la Générale est
accouchée</i></span> would be more absurd than to adjourn the
hearing of a pressing lawsuit because <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Mme. la
Jugesse</i></span> would be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>sur la paille</i></span>. The much graver
and truer objection lies less in the physical than in the
mental and moral inferiority of women. I use moral
in its broadest sense. Women on an average have
little sense of justice, and hardly any sense whatever
of awarding to others a freedom for which they do
not care themselves. The course of all modern legislation
is its tendency to make by-laws, fretting and
vexatious laws trenching unjustifiably on the personal
liberty of the individual. If women were admitted to
political power these laws would be multiplied indefinitely
and incessantly. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>infiniment petit</i></span> would
be the dominate factor in politics. Such meddling
legislation as the Sunday Closing Act in England,
and the Maine Liquor Laws and Carolina Permissive
Bill in the United States would be the joy and aim
of the mass of female voters. Women cannot understand
that you can make no nation virtuous by act
of parliament; they would construct their acts of
parliament on purpose to make people virtuous
whether they chose or not, and would not see that
this would be a form of tyranny as bad as any other.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>A few years ago a State in America (I think it was
Maine or Massachusetts) decreed that because a few
Pomeranian dogs were given to biting people, all
Pomeranian dogs within the State, ill and well, young
and old, should on a certain date be killed; and they
were killed, two thousand odd in number. Now, this
is precisely the kind of legislation which women would
establish in their moments of panic; the disregard of
individual rights, the injustice to innocent animals
and their owners, the invasion of private property
under the doctrinaire’s plea of the general good,
would all commend themselves to women in their
hysterical hours, for women are more tyrannical and
more self-absorbed than men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Renan in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Marc-Aurèle’</span> observes that the decline
of the Roman Empire was hastened, and even,
in much, primarily brought about by the elements of
feebleness, introduced into it by the Christian sects’
admission of women into the active and religious
life of men. The woman-worship springing from
the adoration of the virgin-mother was at the root
of the emasculation and indifference to political and
martial duties, which it brought into the lives of
men who ceased to be either bold soldiers or devoted
citizens.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not think the moral and mental qualities of the
average woman so inferior to those of the average
man as is conventionally supposed. The average
man is not an intellectual nor a noble being; neither
is the average woman. But there are certain solid
qualities in the male creature which are lacking from
the female; such qualities as patience and calmness
in judgment, which are of infinite value, and in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the female character is almost invariably deficient; a
lack in her which makes the prophecy of Dumas, that
she will one day fill judicial and forensic duties, a
most alarming prospect, as alarming as the prediction
of Goldwin Smith that the negro population
will eventually outnumber and extinguish the Aryan
race in the United States.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are men with women’s minds, women with
men’s minds; masculine genius may exist in a
female farm; feminine inconsistency in a male
farm; but these are exceptions to the rule, and
such exceptions are exceedingly rare.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Conservative or patrician party in England
advocates the admission of women into politics for
much the same motives as influenced the early
Christians; they believe that her influence will be
universally exercised to preserve the moral excellences
of the body politic, the sanctity of the home, the
supremacy of religion, the cautiousness of timid and
wary legislators. The class of which the Conservatives
are always thinking as the recipients of female suffrage
would possibly in the main part do so. They would
be persons of property and education, and as such
might be trusted to do nothing rash. But they would
be closely wedded to their prejudices. They would
be narrow in all their views. Their church would
hold a large place in their affections, and their legislation
would be of the character which they now give
to their county society. Moreover, as I have said,
the suffrage once given to women, it could not be
restricted to persons of property. The female factory
hand in her garret would assert that she has as much
right to and need of a voice as the female landowner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>and in face of the fact that the male factory hand and
the male landowner have been placed on the same
footing in political equality, the country would be
unable to refute the argument.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most intelligent and most eloquent of all the
advocates of female suffrage is, as I have said, undoubtedly
Dumas <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fils</i></span>. No man can argue a case
more persuasively; nor is any man more completely
wedded to one side of an argument than he. Yet
even he, her special pleader, in his famous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Appel
aux Femmes</cite></span>, admits that she would bring to science
the scorn of reason, and the indifference to suffering
which she has shown in so many centuries in the
hallucinations and martyrdoms of religion; that she
would throw herself into it with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>audace et frénésie</i></span>;
that she would hold all torture of no account if it
solved an enigma, and would give herself to the
beasts of the field, ‘not to prove that Jesus lived,
but to know if Darwin was right;’ and he passes
on to the triumphant prediction that in sixty years’
time the world will see the offspring of men and
female monkeys, of women and apes; though wherein
this prospect for the future is glorious it were hard
to say.</p>

<p class='c001'>Stripped of that exaggeration which characterises
all the arguments of a writer famous for anomaly,
antithesis and audacity, his prediction that his
favourite client Woman will bring into her pursuit
of the mysteries of science, the same sort of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>folie
furieuse</i></span>, which Blandina and Agatha, and all the
feminine devotees of the early years of Christianity
brought into religion, is a prophecy undoubtedly
correct. She will bring the same into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>politics, into legislation, if she ever obtain a preponderant
power in them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most dangerous tendency in English political
life is at this moment the tendency to legislate <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
saltum</i></span>: female legislation would invariably be conducted
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per saltum</i></span>. The grasshopper-bounds of Mr
Gladstone would be outdone by the kangaroo-leaps
of the female legislator when she moved at all. A
‘masterly inactivity’ would not be understood by her;
nor the profound good sense contained in the advice
which is variously attributed to Talleyrand, Melbourne
and Palmerston, ‘When in doubt do nothing.’ There
is the most mischievous desire in modern politicians
to pull everything about, merely to look as if they
were great reformers; to strew the ashes of the old
order around them long ere they have even settled
the foundations of the new; they do not consider the
inevitable imperfection which must characterise all
human institutions; they do not remember that if
the system, whether political or social, works reasonably
well, it should be supported, even if it be not
symmetrically perfect in theory. These faults are
characteristic of modern politicians, because modern
politicians are for the most part no longer men trained
from their youth in the philosophy of government,
but opportunists who view politics as a field of self-advancement.
Women will bring into politics these
same faults greatly exaggerated and not balanced by
that rough and ready common sense which characterises
most men who are not specialists or visionaries.
Whether the female legislator would imprison all
people who do not go to church, or would imprison
all people who do not attend scientific lectures, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>despotism would be equal; and it is certain that she
would desire to imprison either one class or the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some writer has said, ‘I can as little understand why
any one should fast in Lent, as I can understand why
others should object to their fasting if it please them.’
But this would never be the attitude of the female
politician in regard to either the fasting or the feasting
of others. Sir Henry Thomson, <a id='corr314.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='is'>in</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_314.8'><ins class='correction' title='is'>in</ins></a></span> his admirable
treatise on gastronomy, remarks on the unwisdom of
those who, because a certain food is palatable and
nutritious to themselves, recommend it to every one
they know, making no account of the difference in
constitution and digestion of different persons. There
exists a similar difference in mind and character, for
which women would never make any allowance when
forcing on the world in general their political or social
nostrums. As we again and again see the woman
expecting from her son the purity of manners of a
maiden, and making no account, because she ignores
them entirely, of the imperious necessities of sex, so
we should see her in matters of national or universal
import similarly disregarding or ignoring all facts of
which she chose to take no note. She would increase
and intensify the present despotisms and weaknesses
of political life, and she would put nothing in their
place, for she would have lost her own originality and
charm. Science, indeed, presumes that in educating
her it would strengthen her reasoning powers and
widen her mind into the acceptance of true liberty.
But what proof is there that science would do anything
of that sort? It has never yet showed any true
liberality itself. Nothing can exceed the arrogance
and the despotism of its own demands and pretensions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>the immensity of its self-admiration, the
tyrannical character of its exactions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dumas observes that happy women will not care
for the suffrage because they are happy; he might
have added, that brilliant women will not, because
they have means of influencing men to any side and
to any extent they choose without it. Who, then, will
care to exercise it? All the unhappy women, all the
fretful <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>déclassées</i></span>, all the thousands or tens of thousands
of spinsters who know as much or as little of human
nature as they do of political economy. What will
such as these bring into political life? They can
bring nothing except their own crotches, their own
weakness, their own hysterical agitations. Happy
women are fond of men, but unhappy women hate
them. The legislation voted for by unhappy women
would be as much against men, and all true liberty,
as Dumas himself is against them and it. Men at
present legislate for women with remarkable fairness;
but women would never legislate for men with anything
approaching fairness, and as the numerical preponderance
of votes would soon be on the female
side, if female electors were once accepted, the
prospect is alarming to all lovers of true freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman is the enemy of freedom. Give her
power and she is at once despotic, whether she be
called Elizabeth Tudor or Theroigne de Mirecourt,
whether she be a beneficent or a malevolent ruler,
whether she be a sovereign or a revolutionist. The
enormous pretensions to the monopoly of a man’s
life which women put forward in marriage, are born
of the desire to tyrannise. The rage and amazement
displayed by the woman when a man, whether her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>lover or her husband, is inconstant to her, comes
from that tenacity over the man as a property which
wholly blinds her to her own faults or lack of charm
and power to keep him. A very clever woman never
blames a man for inconstancy to her: she may
perhaps blame herself. Women as a rule attach far
too great a value to themselves; the woman imagines
herself necessary to the man because the man is
necessary to her. Hence that eternal antagonism
of the woman against the man which is one of the
saddest things in human nature. Every writer like
Dumas, who does his best to increase this antagonism,
commits a great crime. The happiness of the human
race lies in the good-will existing between men and
women. This good-will cannot exist so long as
women have the inflated idea of their own value
which they now possess largely in Europe and still
more largely in America. A virtuous woman may
be above rubies, has said Solomon, but this depends
very much on the quality of the virtue; and the idea
prevailing among women that they are valuable,
admirable and almost divine, merely because they
are women, is one of the most mischievous fallacies
born of human vanity, and accepted without
analysis.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been passed, like many another fallacy, from
generation to generation, and the enormous power
of evil which lies in the female sex has been underestimated
or conventionally disregarded for the sake
of a poetic effect. The seducer is continually held
up for condemnation, but the temptress is seldom
remembered. It is common to write of women as
the victims of men, and it is forgotten how many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>men are the victims in their earliest youth of
women. Even in marriage the woman, by her
infidelity, can inflict the most poignant, the most
torturing dishonour on the man; the man’s infidelity
does not in the least touch the honour of the woman.
She can never be in doubt as to the fact of her
children being her own; but he may be perpetually
tortured by such a doubt, nay, may be compelled
through lack of proof to give his name and shelter to
his offspring when he is morally convinced that they
are not his. The woman can bring shame into a
great race as the man can never do, and ofttimes
brings it with impunity. In marriage, moreover, the
influence of the woman, whatever popular prejudices
plead to the contrary, is constantly belittling and
injurious to the intelligence of the man. How many
great artists since the days of Andrea del Sarto have
cursed the woman who has made them barter their
heritage of genius for the ‘pottage’ of worldly
affluence? How much, how often, and how pitilessly
have the petty affairs, the personal greeds, the unsympathetic
and low-toned character of the woman
he has unfortunately wedded, put lead on the winged
feet of the man of genius, and made him leave the
Muses for the god of barter beloved of the common
people in the market-place? Not infrequently what
is called with pious praise a good woman, blameless
in her own conduct and devoted to what she conceives
to be her duties, has been more fatal to the
originality, the integrity, and the intellectual brilliancy
of a man than the worst courtesan could have been.
The injury which women have done the minds of
men may fairly be set off against those social and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>physical injuries which men are said by M. Dumas
to inflict so ruthlessly on women.</p>

<p class='c001'>If outside monogamous marriage the woman suffers
from the man, within it man suffers from the
woman. It is doubtful if but for the obligation to
accept it, which is entailed by property, and the desire
for legitimate heirs, one man in a hundred of the
richer classes would consent to marry. Whenever
Socialism succeeds in abolishing property, monogamy
will be destroyed with it perforce.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the lower strata of society the conjugal association
is made on more equal terms: both work hard
and both frequently come to blows. The poor man
loses less by marriage than the rich man, for he has
his comforts, his food and his clothes looked after
gratis, but the poor woman gains very little indeed
by it; and if she got a hearing in the political world,
she would probably brawl against it, or, which is
still more likely, she would do worse and insist
on marriage laws which should restrict the personal
freedom of the man as severely and as tyrannically
as the Sabbath observance laws do in Scotland, and
as the Puritan exactions did in the early years of
American colonisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The net result of the entrance of the woman into
the political arena can never be for the happiness of
humanity.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Prevant leur revanche de l’immobilité à laquelle
on les a condamnées elles vont courrir par n’importe
quels chemins à côté de l’homme, devant lui si elles
peuvent, contre lui s’il le faut à la conquête d’un
nouveau monde. En matière de sensation la femme
est l’extrême, l’excès, de l’homme.’</span> Dumas recognises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>the inevitable hostility which will be begotten
between the sexes if they war in the same public
arena; but he passes over it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If female suffrage become law anywhere, it must
be given to all women who have not rendered themselves
ineligible for it by criminality. The result
will scarcely be other than the emasculation and the
confusion of the whole world of politics. The ideal
woman is, we know, the type of heroism, fortitude,
wisdom, sweetness and light; but even the ideal
woman is not always distinguished by breadth of
thought, and it is here a question not of the ideal
woman at all, but of the millions of ordinary women
who have as little of the sage in them as of the angel.
Very few women are capable of being the sympathetic
mistress of a great man, or the ennobling mother of a
child of genius. Most women are the drag on the
wheel of the higher aspirations, to the nobler impulses,
to the more original and unconventional opinions, of
the men whom they influence. The prospect of their
increased ascendency over national movements is
very ominous. Is the mass of male humanity ready
to accept it?</p>

<p class='c001'>Women will not find happiness in hostility to men
even if they obtain a victory in it, which is very
doubtful. Women of genius have never hated men:
they have perhaps liked them too well. To the
woman of genius love may not be the sole thing on
earth, as it is to Gretchen; it is only one amongst
the many emotions, charms and delights of life; but
she never denies its attractions, its consolation, its
supreme ecstasy, its exquisite sympathies. Heloise
and Aspasia can love better than Penelope.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Who, then, will become those enemies of men to
whom Dumas looks for the emancipation of the
weaker sex? All the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>délaissées</i></span>, all the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>déclassées</i></span>, all
the discontented, jaded, unloved, embittered women
in the world, all those, and their number is legion,
who have not genius or loveliness, fortune or power,
the wisdom to be mute or the sorcery to charm;
women restless, feverish, envious, irritable, embittered,
whose time hangs heavy on their hands and whose
brains seethe under the froth of ill-assorted and ill-assimilated
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Quarry the granite rock with razors,’ wrote John
Newman, ‘or moor the vessel with a thread of silk;
then may you hope, with such keen and delicate instruments
as human knowledge and human understanding,
to contend against these giants, the passions
and the pride of man;’—or against the difference and
the influence of sex.</p>

<p class='c001'>I know not why women should wish or clamour
at once to resemble and to quarrel with man. The
attitude is an unnatural one; it is sterile, not only
physically but mentally. It is true that the prejudices
and conventionalities of society, and the
fictions of monogamy have stranded a vast number
of women, undistinguished and unhappy, with
no career and no interests, who would imagine
themselves disgraced if they enjoyed the natural
affections of life outside that pale of propriety
which the conventions of society have created.
These are the women who would care for political
power and would be allowed to exercise it. What
could the world gain from such as these? What
would it not lose of the small modicum of freedom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>of contentment, and of wisdom which it already
possesses?</p>

<p class='c001'>To most women success is measured by the balance
at the bank, by the applause of the hour, and nothing
is esteemed which has not received the hall-mark of
the world’s approval. There are exceptions, no
doubt; but they have been and are, I think, fewer
than the advocates of female suffrage would have us
believe. Men too often are mere <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>moutons de Panurge</i></span>,
but women are so almost invariably. The Arab who
weeps when a female child is born to him is perhaps
more correct in his measurement of the sex
than the American who is prepared to make her
the spoiled and wayward sovereign of his household.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have previously used the words ‘mental and moral
inferiority’; it is perhaps necessary to explain them.
By mental inferiority I do not mean that the average
women might not, if educated to it, learn as much
mathematics or as much metaphysics as the ordinary
man. I do not deny that Girton may produce senior
wranglers or physiologists in time to come; it may do
so. But the female mind has a radical weakness
which is often also its peculiar charm; it is intensely
subjective, it is only reluctantly forced to be impersonal,
and it has the strongest possible tendency to
tyranny, as I have said before. In public morality,
also, the female mind is unconsciously unscrupulous;
it is seldom very frank or honest, and it would burn
down a temple to warm its own pannikin. Women
of perfect honesty of intentions and antecedents will
adopt a dishonest course, if they think it will serve an
aim or a person they care for, with a headlong and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>cynical completeness which leaves men far behind it.
In intrigue a man will often have scruples which the
woman brushes aside as carelessly as if they were
cobwebs, if once her passions or her jealousies are
ardently involved. There is not much veracity anywhere
in human nature, but it may always be roughly
calculated that the man will be more truthful than the
woman, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred; his
judgments will be less coloured by personal wishes
and emotions, and his instincts towards justice will be
straighter and less mobile than hers. Were women
admitted into public life, bribery would become a still
greater factor in that life than it now is, which is needless.
All the world over, what is wanted for the
health of the nations is the moral purification of
politics, the elimination of venal and personal views,
the disinterested advocacy and adoption of broad, just
and magnanimous principles of action. Can it be said
that the entry of women into politics would have this
effect? He must be a sanguine man who can think
that it would, and he must have but little knowledge
of women.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>On a les défauts de ses qualités.</i></span> This is one of the
most profound axioms ever evolved out of a study of
human nature. And all which constitutes the charm
of women, mutability, caprice, impressionability,
power of headlong self-abandonment, mingled with
intense subjectiveness and self-engrossment, would
all make of women an inferior but of a most dangerous
political force. Where Mr Gladstone has sent
out troops and recalled them a dozen times, she, with
similar but still greater oscillations of purpose, would
send them out and recall them five hundred times.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Souvent femme varie</i></span> of Francois the First is
true to all time. But in all her variations it is the
Sejanus, the Orloff, the Biron, the Bothwell of the
moment, whom she would wade through seas of
blood to please. This makes at once her dangerousness
and her charm.</p>

<p class='c001'>As scientists look forward to the time when every
man will be bald from boyhood, thus having outgrown
the last likeness to the beasts that perish, so enthusiasts
for female suffrage look forward to a time
when woman will have shed all her fair follies and
rectified all her amusing inconsistencies. What will
she be like then? Very unlovely it may safely be
predicted, as unlovely as the men without hair; very
mischievous for evil, it may also be deemed certain.</p>

<p class='c001'>A French physiologist, who lectured in Russia not
very long ago, was amazed at the howls of impatience
and disdain which was aroused in the female students
amongst his audience in Moscow by his simple statement
that the claims of the arts must not be wholly
lost sight of in the demands and inquiries of science.
They would not tolerate even the mention of the
arts; in their fanaticism they would only worship one
God. The youths were willing to award a place to
art; the maidens would hear of nothing but science.
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Une grande sécheresse de cœur domine la femme qui
se donne à la Science</i></span>;’ and with this dryness of the
soul comes an unmerciful and intolerant disposition
to tyranny over the minds of others.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be denied that the quality which in
women bestows most happiness on those around
them, is that which is called in French and has no
exact descriptive word in English, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>gaîte de cœur</i></span>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Not frivolous unusefulness, or passion for diversion
and excitement, but a sweet and happy spirit, finding
pleasure in small things and great, and shedding
a light like that of Moore’s wild freshness of morning
on the beaten tracks of life. Where will this pleasant
gaiety and smiling radiance go when, harassed,
heated, and blown by the bitter winds of strife, the
woman seeks to outshriek the man on political platforms,
or when with blood-stained hands she bends
over the torture-trough of the physiological laboratory?</p>

<p class='c001'>The humanities do not harden a woman: erudition
may leave her loveliness and grace of form and mind;
though as proficient a Greek and Latin scholar as
any of the learned Italian women of the Renaissance,
yet she may be the joy of her home and the angel of
the poor. A love of learning, of art, of nature, keeps
long young the heart in which it has a place. But the
noisy conflicts of the polling-booths and the pitiless
cruelties of the laboratories will not do so. There is in
every woman, even in the best woman, a sleeping
potentiality for crime, a curious possibility of fiendish
evil. Even her maternal love is dangerously near an
insane ferocity, which at times breaks out in infanticide
or child-murder. Everything which tends to
efface in her gentler and softer instincts tends to
make of her a worse curse to the world than any man
has ever been. If, indeed, in the centuries to come
she should develop into the foe of man, which Dumas
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fils</i></span> wishes her to become, it is by no means improbable
that men, in sheer self-defence, will be compelled
to turn on her and chain her down into the impotency
of servitude once more.</p>

<p class='c001'>If she once leave the power which nature has given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>her over her lovers, her friends, her sons, to become
the opponent, the jealous rival and the acrid enemy
of men, then men, it may be with surety predicted,
will not long keep the gloves on as they fight with
her, but with the brutality which is natural to the
male animal and which is only curbed, not effaced,
by the graceful hypocrisies of society and of courtship,
will with his closed fists send her down into that
lower place of <i>la femelle de l’homme</i>, from which it has
been the effort and the boast of Christianity and of
civilisation to raise her. Woman can never truly
conquer man, except by those irresistible weapons
which the Queen of the Amazons leaned on in her
strife with Alexander.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man has, I repeat, been very fair in his dealings
with women, as far as legislation goes; he could
easily have kept her from all time to the harem, and
it has been a proof of his fairness, if not of his
wisdom, that he has not done so. I have but little
doubt but that, before long, he will cede to her
clamour, and let her seat herself beside him, or
opposite to him, on the benches of his representative
houses. When he does, he will, I think, regret the
loss of the harem.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a lax and perilous inclination in the mass
of mankind, in these latter days of the century, to
give anything which is much asked for.</p>

chariot of national fate, gallop headlong, whither they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>will, downhill if they choose. The pessimism prevalent
in the classes which think, lies at the root of
their indifference to change, and their apathy and
indolence before fresh demands. Men who do think at
all, see how unsatisfactory all things are, how unreal
all religions, how fictitious the bond of marriage, how
mutable the laws of property, how appalling the
future of the world, when there will not be even
standing-room upon it for all the billions of peoples
begotten. And they are, therefore, in that mood
which makes them willing to try any new thing,
even as men at death’s door languidly affirm their
despairing readiness to try any nostrum or panacea
tendered to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Woman may, will, very possibly, snatch from the
nerveless hand of the sick man those legal and legislative
rights which she covets. The political movements
of modern times have been always in the
direction of giving unlimited power to blind and
unmeasured masses, whose use of that which is thus
rashly given them the boldest prophet dare not predict.
Such movement will probably give political
power to women.</p>

<p class='c001'>I confess that I, for one, dread the day which shall
see this further development of that crude and
restless character of the nineteenth century, which,
with sublime self-contentment and self-conceit, it

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>VULGARITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>If the present age were less of a hypocrite than
it is, probably its conscience would compel it to
acknowledge that vulgarity is excessively common
in it; more common than in any preceding time,
despite its very bountiful assumptions of good taste
and generalised education.</p>

<p class='c001'>Vulgarity is almost a modern vice; it is doubtful
whether classic ages knew it at all, except in that
sense in which it must be said that even Socrates
was vulgar, <i>i.e.</i>, inquisitiveness, and in that other
sense of love of display to which the tailless dog
of Alkibiades was a mournful victim. We are aware
that Alkibiades said he cut off his dog’s tail and
ears to give the Athenians something to talk of,
that they might not gossip about what else he was
doing. But though gossip was no doubt rife in
Athens, still, vulgarity in its worst sense, that is, in
the struggle to seem what the struggler is not, could
have had no existence in times when every man’s
place was marked out for him, and the lines of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>demarcation could not be overstepped. Vulgarity
began when the freedman began to give himself airs,
and strut and talk as though he had been a porphyrogenitus;
and this pretension was only possible
in a decadence.</p>

<p class='c001'>There may be a vast vulgarity of soul with an
admirable polish of manners, and there may be a
vast vulgarity of manner with a generous delicacy
of soul. But, in this life, we are usually compelled
to go by appearances, and we can seldom see beyond
them, except in the cases of those few dear to, and
intimate with us. We must be pardoned if we judge
by the externals which are palpable to us and do not
divine the virtues hidden beneath them.</p>

<p class='c001'>An essayist has recently defined good manners as
courtesy and truthfulness. Now this is simply nonsense.
A person may be full of kindly courtesies,
and never utter the shadow of an untruth, and yet he
may have red-hot hands, a strident voice, an insupportable
manner, dropped aspirates, and a horribly
gross joviality, which make him the vulgarest of the
vulgar. It is often said that a perfect Christian is
a perfect gentleman, but this also is a very doubtful
postulate. The good Christian may ‘love his neighbour
as himself,’ and yet he may offend his ear with
a cockney accent and sit down to his table with unwashed
hands. ‘Manners make the man,’ is an old
copy-book adage, and is not quiet true either: but
it is certain that, without good manners, the virtues
of a saint may be more offensive, by far, to society
than the vices of a sinner. It is a mistake to confuse
moral qualities with the social qualities which
come from culture and from breeding.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>I have said that Socrates must have been in a
certain degree vulgar, because he was so abominably
inquisitive. For surely all interrogation is vulgar?
When strangers visit us, we can at once tell whether
they are ill-bred or high-bred persons by the mere
fact of whether they do, or do not, ask us questions.
Even in intimacy, much interrogation is a vulgarity;
it may be taken for granted that your friend will tell
you what he wishes you to know. Here and there
when a question seems necessary, if silence would
imply coldness and indifference, then must it be put
with the utmost delicacy and without any kind of
semblance of its being considered a demand which
must be answered. All interrogation for purposes of
curiosity is vulgar, curiosity itself being so vulgar;
and even the plea of friendship or of love cannot be
pleaded in extenuation of it. But if love and friendship
be pardoned their inquisitiveness, the anxiety
of the general public to have their curiosity satisfied
as to the habits, ways and scandals of those who are
conspicuous in any way, is mere vulgar intrusiveness,
which the ‘society newspapers,’ as they are called, do,
in all countries, feed to a most pernicious degree.
Private life has no longer any door that it can shut
and bolt against the intrusion of the crowd. Whether
a royal prince has quarrelled with his wife, or a country
mayoress has quarelled with a house-maid, the press,
large or small, metropolitan or provincial, serves up
the story to the rapacious curiosity of the world-wide,
or the merely local public. This intrusion on personal
and wholly private matters is an evil which
increases every day; it is a twofold evil, for it is alike
a curse to those whose privacy it poisons, and a curse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>to those whose debased appetites it feeds. It would
be wholly impossible, in an age which was not vulgar,
for those journals which live on personalities to find a
public. They are created by the greed of the multitude
which calls for them. It is useless to blame
the proprietors and editors who live on them;
the true culprits are the readers—the legions of
readers—who relish and patronise them, and without
whose support such carrion flies could not live out a
summer.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘It is so easy to talk about people’ is the excuse
constantly made by those who are reproved for
gossiping about others who are not even, perhaps,
their personal acquaintances. Yes, it is very easy;
the most mindless creature can do it; the asp, be he
ever so small, can sting the hero, and perchance can
slay him; but gossip of a malicious kind is intensely
vulgar, and to none but the vulgar should it be welcome,
even if their vulgarity be such as is hidden
under a cloak of good manners. It is true that there
is a sort of spurious wit which springs out of
calumny, and which is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malgré nous</i></span> too often diverting
to the best of us, and this sort of personality has a
kind of contagious attraction which is apt to grow
even on those who loathe it, much as absinthe does.
But it is none the less vulgar, and vulgarises the mind
which admits its charm, as absinthe slowly eats up
the vitality and the digestive powers of those who
yield to its attraction. Were there no vulgarity, it
may be said that there would be no scandal; for
scandal is born of that marked desire to think ill of
others, and that restless inquisitiveness into affairs
that do not concern us, which is pre-eminently vulgar.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>When we talk of the follies of our friends, or the
backslidings of our acquaintances, in a duchess’s
boudoir, we are every whit as vulgar as the fishwives
or the village dames jabbering of the sins of Jack and
Jill in any ale-house. The roots of the vulgarity are
the same—inquisitiveness and idleness. All personalities
are vulgar; and whether personalities are used
as the base weapons to turn an argument, or as the
equally base bait wherewith to make the fortunes
of a newspaper, they are alike offensive and unpardonable.
The best characteristic of the best society
would be that they should be absolutely forbidden
in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another reason why the present age is more vulgar
than any preceding it, may also be found in the fact
that, in it pretension is infinitely more abundant, because
infinitely more successful than it ever was before.
An autocratic aristocracy, or a perfect equality, would
equally make pretension impossible. But, at the present
time, aristocracy is without power, and equality
has no existence outside the dreams of Utopians.
The result is, that the whole vast mass of humanity,
uncontrolled, can struggle, and push, and strive, and
sweat, and exhaust itself, to appear something that it
is not, and all repose and calm and dignity, which are
the foes of vulgarity, are destroyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Essayists have often attempted to define high
breeding; but it remains indefinable. Its incomparable
charm, its perfect ease, its dignity which is never
asserted, yet which the most obtuse can always feel
is in reserve, its very manner of performing all the
trifling acts of social usage and obligation, are beyond
definition. They are too delicate and too subtle for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the harshness of classification. The courtier of the
old story who, when told by Louis Quatorze to go
first, went first without protest, was a high-bred
gentleman. Charles the First, when he kept his
patience and his peace under the insults of his trial
at Westminster, was one also. Mme. du Barry
screams and sobs at the foot of the guillotine; Marie
Antoinette is calm.</p>

<p class='c001'>True, I once knew a perfectly well-bred person
who yet could neither read nor write. I can see her
now in her little cottage in the Derbyshire woods, on
the brown, flashing water of the Derwent River
(Darron, as the people of Derbyshire call it), a fair,
neat, stout, old woman with a round face and a clean
mob cap. She had been a factory girl in her youth
(indeed, all her womanhood had worked at the cotton
mill on the river), and now was too old to do anything
except to keep her one-roomed cottage, with its
tall lancet windows, its peaked red roof, and its
sweet-smelling garden, with its high elder hedge, as
neat and fresh and clean as human hands could
make them. Dear old Mary! with her racy,
Chaucerian English, and her happy, cheerful temper,
and her silver spectacles, which some of the ‘gentry’
had given her, and her big Bible on the little round
table, and the black kettle boiling in the wide fireplace,
and her casements wide open to the nodding
moss-roses and the sweet-brier boughs! Dear old
Mary! she was a bit of Shakespeare’s England, of
Milton’s England, of Spenser’s England, and the
memory of her, and of her cottage by the brown,
bright river often comes back to me across the width
of years. She was a perfectly well-bred person; she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>made one welcome to her little home with simple, perfect
courtesy, without flutter, or fuss, or any effort of
any sort; she had neither envy nor servility; grateful
for all kindness, she never either abused the ‘gentry’
or flattered them; and her admirable manner never
varied to the peddler at her door or to the squire of
her village; would never have varied, I am sure, if the
queen of her country had crossed her door-step. For
she had the repose of contentment, of simplicity, and
of that self-respect which can never exist where envy
and effort are. She could neither read nor write; she
scrubbed and washed and worked for herself; she
had never left that one little green nook of Derbyshire,
or seen other roads than the steep shady highway
which went up to the pine woods behind her
house; but she was a perfectly well-bred woman,
born of a time calmer, broader, wiser, more generous
than ours.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few miles off in the valley, where she never by any
chance went, the excursion trains used to vomit forth,
at Easter and in Whitsun week, throngs of the mill
hands of the period, cads and their flames, tawdry,
blowzy, noisy, drunken; the women with dress that
aped ‘the fashion,’ and pyramids of artificial flowers
on their heads; the men as grotesque and hideous in
their own way; tearing through woods and fields like
swarms of devastating locusts, and dragging the fern
and hawthorn boughs they had torn down in the dust,
ending the lovely spring day in pot-houses, drinking
gin and bitters, or heavy ales by the quart, and tumbling
pell-mell into the night train, roaring music-hall
choruses; sodden, tipsy, yelling, loathsome creatures,
such as make the monkey look a king, and the newt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>seem an angel beside humanity—exact semblance and
emblem of the vulgarity of the age.</p>

<p class='c001'>Far away from those green hills and vales of Derbyshire
I pass to-day in Tuscany a little wine-house
built this year; it has been run up in a few months
by a speculative builder; it has its name and purpose
gaudily sprawling in letters two feet long across its
front; it has bright pistachio shutters and a slate roof
with no eaves; it has a dusty gravelled space in front
of it; it looks tawdry, stingy, pretentious, meagre,
squalid, fine, all in one. A little way off it is another
wine-house, built somewhere about the sixteenth
century; it is made of solid grey stone; it has a roof
of brown tiles, with overhanging eaves like a broad-leafed
hat drawn down to shade a modest countenance;
it has deep arched windows, with some carved
stone around and above them; it has an outside stairway
in stone and some ivy creeping about it; it has
grass before it and some cherry and peach trees;
the only sign of its calling is the bough hung above
the doorway. The two wine-houses are, methinks,
most apt examples of the sobriety and beauty which
our forefathers put into the humblest things of life
and the flimsy tawdriness and unendurable hideousness
which the present age displays in all it produces.
I have not a doubt that the one under the cherry tree,
with its bough for a sign, and its deep casements,
and its clean, aged look, will be soon deserted by the
majority of the carters and fruit growers and river
fishermen who pass this way, in favour of its vulgar
rival, where I am quite sure the wines will be watered
tenfold and the artichokes fried in rancid oil; its
patrons will eat and drink ill, but they will go to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>new one, I doubt not, all of them, except a few old
men, who will cling to the habit of their youth. Very
possibly those who own the old one will feel compelled
to adapt themselves to the progress of the age;
will cut the eaves off their roof, hew down their fruit
trees, whitewash their grey stone, and turn their fine old
windows into glass doors with pistachio blinds—and
still it will not equal its rival in the eyes of the carters
and fishers and gardeners, since it was not made
yesterday! Neither its owners nor its customers can
scarcely be expected to be wiser than are all the
municipal counsellors of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perfect simplicity is the antithesis of vulgarity, and
simplicity is the quality which modern life is most
calculated to destroy. The whole tendency of
modern education is to create an intense self-consciousness;
and whoever is self-conscious has lost the
charm of simplicity, and has already become vulgar
in a manner. The most high-bred persons are those
in whom we find a perfect naturalness, an entire
absence of self-consciousness. The whole influence
of modern education is to concentrate the mind of the
child on itself; as it grows up this egoism becomes
confirmed; you have at once an individual both self-absorbed
and affected, both hard towards others and
vain of itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>When pretension was less possible, vulgarity was
less visible, because its chief root did not exist. When
the French nobility, in the time of Louis Quatorze,
began to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>engraisser leurs terres</i></span> with the ill-acquired
fortunes of farmer-generals’ daughters, their manners
began to deteriorate and their courtesy began to be
no more than an empty shell filled with rottenness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>They were not yet vulgar in their manners, but vulgarity
had begun to taint their minds and their race,
and their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mésalliances</i></span> did not have the power to save
them from the scaffold. Cowardice is always vulgar,
and the present age is pre-eminently cowardly; full
of egotistic nervousness and unconcealed fear of all
those physical dangers to which science has told all
men they are liable. Pasteur is its god, and the
microbe its Mephistopheles. A French writer defined
it, the other day, as the age of the ‘infinitely little.’
It might be also defined as the age of absorbing self-consciousness.
It is eternally placing itself in innumerable
attitudes to pose before the camera of a
photographer; the old, the ugly, the obscure, the
deformed, delight in multiplying their likenesses on
cardboard, even more than do the young, the beautiful,
the famous, and the well-made. All the resources
of invention are taxed to reproduce effigies of persons
who have not a good feature in their faces or a correct
line in their limbs, and all the resources of science
are solicited to keep breath in the bodies of people
who had better never have lived at all. Cymon grins
before a camera as self-satisfied as though he were
Adonis, and Demos is told that he is the one sacred
offspring of the gods to which all creation is freely
sacrificed. Out of this self-worship springs a hideous,
a blatant vulgarity, which is more likely to increase
than to diminish. Exaggeration of our own value is
one of the most offensive of all the forms of vulgarity,
and science has much to answer for in its present
pompous and sycophantic attitude before the importance
and the excellence of humanity. Humanity
gets drunk on such intoxicating flattery of itself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Remark how even what is called the ‘best’ society
sins as these do who forsake the grey stone house for
the slate-roofed and stuccoed one. There has been
an endless outcry about good taste in the last score
of years. But where is it to be really found? Not
in the crowds who rush all over the world by steam,
nor in those who dwell in modern cities. Good taste
cannot be gregarious. Good taste cannot endure a
square box to live in, however the square box may
be coloured. That the modern poet can reside in
Westbourne Grove, and the modern painter in Cromwell
Road, is enough to set the hair of all the Muses
on end. If Carlyle had lived at Concord, like Emerson,
how much calmer and wiser thought, how much
less jaundiced raving, would the world have had from
him! That is to say, if he would have had the soul
to feel the green and fragrant tranquillity of Concord,
which is doubtful. Cities may do good to the minds
of men by the friction of opinions found in them, but
life spent only in cities under their present conditions
is debasing and pernicious, for those conditions are
essentially and hopelessly vulgar.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the soul of Shelley in the body of Sardanapalus,
with the riches of Crœsus, could now dwell in Paris,
London, or New York, it is doubtful whether he
would be able to resist the pressure of the social
forces round him and strike out any new forms of
pleasure or festivity. All that he would be able to
do would, perhaps, be to give better dinners than
other people. The forms of entertainment in them
are monotonous, and trivial where they are not coarse.
When a man colossally rich, and therefore boundlessly
powerful, appears, what new thing does he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>originate? What fresh grace does he add to society;
what imagination does he bring into his efforts to
amuse the world? None; absolutely none. He may
have more gold plate than other people; he may
have more powdered footmen about his hall; he may
have rosewood mangers for his stables; but he has
no invention, no brilliancy, no independence of tradition;
he will follow all the old worn ways of what is
called pleasure, and he will ask crowds to push and
perspire on his staircases, and will conceive that he
has amused the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>When one reflects on the immense possibilities of an
enormously rich man, or a very great prince, and sees
all the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>banalité</i></span>, the repetition, and the utter lack of
any imagination, in all that these rich men and these
great princes do, one is forced to conclude that the
vulgarity of the world at large has been too much for
them, and that they can no more struggle against it
than a rhinoceros against a quagmire; his very weight
serves to make the poor giant sink deeper and quicker
into the slime.</p>

<p class='c001'>From his birth to his death it is hard indeed for
any man, even the greatest, to escape the vulgarity of
the world around him. Scarcely is he born than the
world seizes him, to make him absurd with the fussy
conventionalities of the baptismal ceremony, and, after
clogging his steps, and clinging to him throughout
his whole existence, vulgarity will seize on his dead
body and make even that grotesque with the low
comedy of its funeral rites. Had Victor Hugo not
possessed very real qualities of greatness in him he
would have been made ridiculous forever by the farce
of the burial which Paris intended as an honour to him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>All ceremonies of life which ought to be characterised
by simplicity and dignity, vulgarity has marked
and seized for its own. What can be more vulgar
than the marriage ceremony in what are called
civilised countries? What can more completely
take away all delicacy, sanctity, privacy and poetry
from love than these crowds, this parade, these coarse
exhibitions, this public advertisement of what should
be hidden away in silence and in sacred solitude?
To see a marriage at the Madeleine or St Philippe du
Roule, or St George’s, Hanover Square, or any other
great church in any great city of the world, is to see
the vulgarity of modern life at its height. The rape
of the Sabines, or the rough bridal still in favour with
the Turcomans and Tartars, is modesty and beauty
beside the fashionable wedding of the nineteenth
century, or the grotesque commonplace of civil marriage.
Catullus would not have written ‘O Hymen
Hymenæ!’ if he had been taken to contemplate the
thousand and one rare petticoats of a modern trousseau,
or the tricolored scarf of a continental mayor,
or the chairs and tables of a registry office in England
or America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern habit has contrived to dwarf and to vulgarise
everything, from the highest passions to the
simplest actions; and its chains are so strong that
the king in his palace and the philosopher in his study
cannot keep altogether free of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why has it done so? Presumably because this
vulgarity is acceptable and agreeable to the majority.
In modern life the majority, however blatant, ignorant
or incapable, gives the law, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>âmes d’elite</i></span> have,
being few in number, no power to oppose to the flood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of coarse commonplace, with which they are surrounded
and overwhelmed. Plutocracy is everywhere
replacing aristocracy, and has its arrogance
without its elegance. The tendency of the age
is not towards the equalising of fortunes, despite
the boasts of modern liberalism; it is rather
towards the creation of enormous individual fortunes,
rapidly acquired and lying in an indigested mass on
the stomach of Humanity. It is not the possessors
of these riches who will purify the world from vulgarity.
Vulgarity is, on the contrary, likely to live,
and multiply, and increase in power and in extent.
Haste is one of its parents, and pretension the other.
Hurry can never be either gracious or graceful, and
the effort to appear what we are not is the deadliest
foe to peace and to personal dignity.</p>

Dans les anciennes sociétés la fortune comme la

<p class='c001'>These words of the celebrated French critic, Brunetière,
written <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>apropos</i></span> of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La France Juive</cite></span>, are essentially
true, even if truth is in them somewhat exaggerated,
for in the middle ages riches were often acquired
by violence, or pandering to vice in high places. The
modern worship of riches <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span> is a vulgarity, and
as he has said, it even amounts to a crime.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such opinions as his are opposed to the temper of
the age; are called <a id='corr341.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='reactionory'>reactionary</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_341.14'><ins class='correction' title='reactionory'>reactionary</ins></a></span>, old-fashioned and
exclusive; but there is a great truth in them. If
the edge were not rubbed off of personal dignity, if
the bloom were not brushed off of good taste, and the
appreciation of privacy and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>recueillement</i></span> greatly
weakened, all the personalities of the press and of
society would never have been endured or permitted
to attain the growth which they have attained. The
faults of an age are begotten and borne out of itself;
it suffers from what it creates. One looks in vain, in
this age, for any indication of any new revolt against
the bond of vulgarity, or return to more delicate, more
dignified, more reserved manners of life. If socialism
should have its way with the world (which is probable),
it will not only be vulgar, it will be sordid; all loveliness
will perish; and, with all ambition forbidden,
heroism and greatness will be things unknown, and
genius a crime against the divinity of the Eternal
Mediocre. The socialism of Bakounine, of Marx, of
Krapotkine, of Tolstoï, is the dreariest and dullest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>all earthly things—an Utopia without an idea, a level
as blank and hopeless as the dust plains of a Russian
summer. It may be a vision, dreary as it is, which
will one day be realised. There is hourly growing in
the world a dull and sullen antagonism against all
superiority, all pre-eminent excellence, whether of
intellect, birth or manner; and this jealousy has the
germs in it of that universal war on superiority which
will be necessary to bring about the triumph of
socialism. At present, society is stronger than the
socialists; is stronger in Germany, in America, in
Italy, in Russia, even in France; but how much
longer it will have this superior strength who can
say? Socialism being founded, not on love, as it
pretends, but on hatred—hatred of superiority—appeals
to a malignant instinct in human nature, in the
mediocrity of human nature, which is likely to increase
as the vast and terrible increase of population
makes the struggle of existence more close and more
desperate. Socialism will very possibly ravage and
lay waste the earth like a hydra-headed Attila; but
there will be nothing to be hoped for from it in aid
of the graces, the charms, or the dignity of life. Were
riches more careful of these, they would hold their
own better in the contest with socialism. Were
society more elegant, more self-respecting, more intelligent,
more distinguished, it would give its defenders
much more reason and strength to plead in
favour of its preservation.</p>

<p class='c001'>But society is on the whole both stupid and vulgar.
It scarcely knows the good from the bad in anything.
If a fashion is set, it follows the fashion sheepishly,
without knowing why it does so. It has neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>genuine conscience, nor genuine taste. It will stone
A. for what it admires in B., and will crucify Y. for
what it smilingly condones in Z. It has no true
standard for anything. It is at once hypercritical
and over-indulgent. What it calls its taste is but a
purblind servility. It will take the deformed basset-hound
as a pet, and neglect all the beautiful canine
races; it will broil in throngs on a bare strip of sand,
and avoid all the lovely places by wood and sea; it
will worship a black rose, and never glance at all the
roses which nature has made. If only Fashion
decree, the basset-hound, the bare sand, and the black
rose are to it the idols of the hour. It has no consistency;
it will change the Japanese for the Rococo,
the Renaissance for the Queen Anne, the Watteau
for the Oriental, or mix them all together, at the mere
weathercock dictate of fashion or caprice. It has no
more consistency in its code of morals; it will ask
Messalina anywhere as long as a prince speaks to her
and she is the fashion; if the prince ceases to speak
and she ceases to be the fashion, it puts up its fan
at her vices, and scores her name out of its visiting
list. There is no reality in either its pretensions to
morality or good taste.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we think of the immense potentialities and
capabilities of society, of all that it might become, of
all that it might accomplish, and behold the monotony
of insipid folly, of ape-like imitation, of consummate
hypocrisy, in which it is content to roll on
through the course of the years, one cannot but feel
that, if its ultimate doom be to be swallowed up and
vomited forth again, lifeless and shapeless, by the
dragon of socialism, it will have no more than its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>due; that it will fall through its own sloth and vileness
as the empire of Rome fell under the hordes of
the barbarians.</p>

<p class='c001'>That charming writer Gustave Droz has said that
railways are at once the symbol and the outcome of
the vulgarity of the age; and that whoever lets himself
be shot through space like a parcel through a
tube, and condescends to eat in a crowd at a station
buffet, cannot by any possibility retain dignity of
appearance or elegance of manners. The inelegant
scrambling and pushing, and elbowing and vociferating
of a modern railway station form an exact and
painful image of this restless, rude and gregarious
century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Compare the stately progress of a Queen Elizabeth,
or a Louis Quatorze through the provinces, calm,
leisurely, dignified, magnificent, with the modern
monarch or prince always in movement as if he were
a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commis-voyageur</i></span>, interviewed ridiculously on a
square of red carpet on a station platform, and
breathlessly listening to a breathless mayor’s silly
and verbose address of welcome; then rushing off,
as if he were paid so much an hour, to be jostled at
a dog show, hustled at an agricultural exhibition,
and forced to shake hands with the very politicians
who have just brought before the House the abolition
of the royal prerogative. It is not the question here
of whether royalty is, or is not, better upheld or
abolished; but so long as royalty exists, and so long
as its existence is dear to many millions, and esteemed
of benefit by them, it is infinitely to be regretted that
it should have lost, as it has lost, all the divinity
which should hedge a king.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>Recent publications of royal feelings and royal
doings may be of use to the enemies of royalty by
showing what twaddling nothings fill up its day; but
to royalty itself they can only be belittleing and injurious
in a great degree, whilst the want of delicacy
which could give to the public eye such intimate
revelations of personal emotions and struggles with
poverty, as the publication of the <cite>Letters of the
Princess Alice of England</cite> made public property, is
so staring and so strange that it seems like the public
desecration of a grave.</p>

<p class='c001'>Books, in which the most trivial and personal
details are published in print by those who should
veil their faces like the Latin in sorrow and veil them
in their purples, could only be possible in an age in
which vulgarity has even reached up and sapped the
very foundations of all thrones. One cannot but feel
pity for the poor dead princess, who would surely
have writhed under such indignity, when one sees in
the crudeness and cruelty of print her homely descriptions
of suckling her children and struggling with a
narrow purse, descriptions so plainly intended for no
eyes but those of the person to whom they were addressed.
Better—how much better!—have buried with
her those humble letters in which the soul is seen naked
as in its prayer-closet, and which are no more fit to
be dragged out into the garish day of publicity than
the bodily nakedness of a chaste woman is fit to be
pilloried in a market-place. I repeat, only an age
intensely and despairingly vulgar could have rendered
the publication of such letters as those royal letters to
royal persons possible. Letters of intimacy are the
most sacred things of life; they are the proofs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>most intimate trust and confidence which can be
placed in us; and to make them public is to violate
all the sweetest sanctities of life and of death.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>La pudeur de l’âme</i> is forever destroyed where such
exposure of feelings, the most intimate and the most
personal, becomes possible. In the preface to those
letters it is said that the public will in these days
know everything about us, and therefore it is better
that they should know the truth from us. Not so;
this attitude is indeed submission to the mob: it is unveiling
the bosom in the market-place. Any amount
of calumny cannot destroy dignity; but dignity is
forever destroyed when it condescends to call in the
multitude to count its tears and see its kisses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great man and the great woman should say
to the world: ‘Think of me what you choose. It
is indifferent to me. You are not my master; and I
shall never accept you as a judge.’ This should be
the attitude of all royalty, whether that of the king,
the hero, or the genius.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>THE STATE AS AN IMMORAL <br /> FACTOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>The tendency of the last years of the nineteenth
century is toward increase in the powers
of the state and decrease in the powers of the individual
citizen. Whether the government of a country
be at this moment nominally free, or whether it be
avowedly despotic, whether it be an empire, a republic,
a constitutional monarchy, or a self-governing
and neutralised principality, the actual government
is a substitution of state machinery for individual
choice and individual liberty. In Servia, in Bulgaria,
in France, in Germany, in England, in America, in
Australia, anywhere you will, the outward forms of
government differ widely, but beneath all there is
the same interference of the state with personal
volition, the same obligation for the individual to
accept the dictum of the state in lieu of his own judgment.
The only difference is that such a pretension
is natural and excusable in an autocracy; in a constitutional
or republican state it is an anomaly, even
an absurdity. But whether it be considered admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>or accursed, the fact is conspicuous that every year
adds to the pretensions and powers of the state, and
every year diminishes the personal freedom of the
man.</p>

<p class='c001'>To whatever the fact be traceable, it is there, and
it is probably due to the increase of a purely <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>doctrinaire</i></span>
education, which with itself increases the number of
persons who look upon humanity as a drill-sergeant
looks upon battalions of conscripts; the battalions
must learn to move mechanically in masses, and no
single unit of them must be allowed to murmur or to
fall out of the ranks. That this conscript, or that, may
be in torture all the while matters nothing whatever
to the drill-sergeant. That what would have been an
excellent citizen makes a rebellious or inefficient conscript
is not his business either; he only requires a
battalion which moves with mechanical precision.
The state is but a drill-sergeant on a large scale, with
a whole nationality marched out on the parade-ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever were in other respects the evils attendant
on other ages than this, those ages were favourable
to the development of individuality, and therefore of
genius. The present age is opposed to such development;
and the more the state manipulates the man,
the more completely will individuality and originality
be destroyed. The state requires a tax-paying
machine in which there is no hitch, an exchequer in
which there is never a deficit, and a public, monotonous,
obedient, colourless, spiritless, moving unanimously
and humbly like a flock of sheep along a
straight, high road between two walls. That is the
ideal of every bureaucracy; and what is the state except
a crystallised bureaucracy? It is the habit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>those who uphold the despotism of government to
speak as though it were some impersonal entity, some
unerring guide, some half-divine thing like the pillar
of fire which the Israelites imagined conducted them
in their exodus. In actual fact, the state is only the
executive; representing the momentary decisions of a
majority which is not even at all times a genuine
majority, but is, in frequent cases, a fabricated and
fictitious preponderance, artificially and arbitrarily produced.
There can be nothing noble, sacred, or unerring
in such a majority; it is fallible and fallacious;
it may be in the right, it may be in the wrong; it may
light by accident on wisdom, or it may plunge by
panic into folly. There is nothing in its origin or its
construction which can render it imposing in the sight
of an intelligent and high-spirited man. But the mass
of men are not intelligent and not high-spirited, and
so the incubus which lies on them through it they
support, as the camel his burden, sweating beneath
it at every pore. The state is the empty
cap of Gessler, to which all but Tell consent to bow.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been made a reproach to the centuries preceding
this one that in them privilege occupied the
place of law; but, though privilege was capricious and
often unjust, it was always elastic, sometimes benignant;
law—civil law, such as the state frames and
enforces—is never elastic and is never benignant. It
is an engine which rolls on its own iron lines, and
crushes what it finds opposed to it, without any regard
to the excellence of what it may destroy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The nation, like the child, becomes either brutalised
by over-drilling, or emasculated by having all its actions
and opinions continually prescribed for it. It is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>doubted whether any precautions or any system could
compass what the state in many countries is now
endeavouring to do, by regulation and prohibition, to
prevent the spread of infectious maladies. But it is
certain that the nervous terrors inspired by state laws
and by-laws beget a malady of the mind more injurious
than the bodily ills which so absorb the state.
Whether Pasteur’s inoculation for rabies be a curse
or a boon to mankind, there can be no question
that the exaggerated ideas which it creates, the fictitious
importance which it lends to what was previously
a most rare malady, the nightmare horrors it
invokes, and the lies which its propagandists, to justify
its pretences, find themselves compelled to invent,
produce a dementia and hysteria in the public mind
which is a disease far more widespread and dangerous
than mere canine rabies (unassisted by science and
government) could ever have become.</p>

<p class='c001'>The dissemination of cowardice is a greater evil
than would be the increase of any physical ill whatever.
To direct the minds of men in nervous terror
to their own bodies is to make of them a trembling
and shivering pack of prostrate poltroons. The
microbe may be the cause of disease; but the nervous
terrors generated in the microbe’s name are worse
evils than any bacillus. It is the physiologist’s trade
to increase these terrors; he lives by them, and by
them alone has his being, but when the state takes
his crotchets and quackeries in earnest and forces
them upon the public as law, the effect is physically
and mentally disastrous. The cholera as a disease is
bad enough, but worse than itself by far are the
brutal egotism, the palsied terror, the convulsive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>agonies, with which it is met, and which the state in
all countries does so much to increase. Fear alone
kills five-tenths of its victims, and during its latest
visitation in the streets of Naples people would spring
up from their seats, shriek that they had cholera,
and fall dead in convulsions, caused by sheer panic;
whilst in many country places the villagers fired on
railway trains which they imagined might carry the
dreaded malady amongst them. This kind of panic
cannot be entirely controlled by any state, but it
might be mitigated by judicious moderation, instead
of being, as it is, intensified and hounded on by
the press, the physiologists, and the governments all
over the known world.</p>

<p class='c001'>The state has already passed its cold, hard, iron-plated
arms between the parent and the offspring,
and is daily dragging and forcing them asunder. The
old moral law may say ‘Honour your father and
mother,’ etc., etc., but the state says, on the contrary:
‘Leave your mother ill and untended whilst you
attend to your own education; and summon your
father to be fined and imprisoned if he dare lay a
hand on you when you disgrace and deride him.’
The other day a working man in London was sentenced
to a fortnight’s imprisonment with hard labour,
because, being justly angry with his little girl for
disobeying his orders and staying out night after
night in the streets, he struck her twice with a
leathern strap, and she was ‘slightly bruised.’ The
man asked pertinently what was the world coming to
if a parent might not correct his child as he thought
fit. What can be the relations of this father and
daughter when he leaves the prison to which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>sent him? What authority can he have in her sight?
What obedience will he be able to exact from her?
The bruises from the strap would soon pass away,
but the rupture, by the sentence of the tribunal, of
parental and filial ties can never be healed. The
moral injury done to the girl by this interference of
the state is irreparable, ineffaceable. The state has
practically told her that disobedience is no offence,
and has allowed her to be the accuser and jailer of
one who, by another canon of law, is said to be set
in authority over her both by God and man.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moral and the civil law alike decree and enforce
the inviolability of property; anything which
is the property of another, be it but of the value of
a copper coin, cannot be taken by you without your
becoming liable to punishment as a thief. This, by
the general consent of mankind, has been esteemed
correct, just and necessary. But the state breaks
this law, derides it, rides rough-shod over it, when
for its own purposes it requires the property of a
private person; it calls the process by various names—condemnation,
expropriation, annexation, etc.; but it
is a seizure, a violent seizure, and a essentially seizure
against the owner’s will. If a man enter your kitchen-garden
and take a few onions or a few potatoes, you
can hold, prosecute and imprison him; the state takes
the whole garden, and turns you out of it, and turns it
into anything else which for the moment seems to
the state excellent or advantageous, and against the
impersonal robber you can do naught. The state
considers it compensation enough to pay an arbitrary
value; but not only are there many possessions,
notably in land, for the loss of which no equivalent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>could reconcile us, but the state herein sets up a
principle which is never accorded in law. If the man
who steals the onions offers to pay their value, he is
not allowed to do so, nor is the owner of the onions
allowed to accept such compensation; it is called
‘compounding a felony.’ The state alone may commit
this felony with impunity, and pay what it
chooses after committing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The state continually tampers with and tramples on
private property, taking for itself what and where and
how it pleases; the example given to the public is
profoundly immoral. The plea put forth in excuse
for its action by the state is that of public benefit;
the interests of the public cannot, it avers, be sacrificed
to private interest or ownership or rights of any sort.
But herein it sets up a dangerous precedent. The
man who steals the potatoes might argue in his own
justification that it is better in the interest of the
public that one person should lose a few potatoes
than that another person should starve for want of
them, and so, either in prison or in poorhouse, become
chargeable to the nation. If private rights and the
sacredness of property can be set at naught by the
state for its own purposes, they cannot be logically
held to be sacred in its courts of law for any individual.
The state claims immunity for theft on the
score of convenience, so then may the individual.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the civil law be in conflict with and contradiction
of religious law, as has been shown elsewhere,<a id='rN' /><a href='#fN' class='c015'><sup>[N]</sup></a> it is
none the less in perpetual opposition to moral law
and to all the finer and more generous instincts of
the human soul. It preaches egotism as the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>duty of man, and studiously inculcates cowardice as
the highest wisdom. In its strenuous endeavour to
cure physical ills it does not heed what infamies it
may sow broadcast in the spiritual fields of the mind
and heart. It treats altruism as criminal when
altruism means indifference to the contagion of any
infectious malady. The precautions enjoined in any
such malady, stripped bare of their pretences, really
mean the naked selfishness of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>sauve qui peut</i></span>.
The pole-axe used on the herd which has been in contact
with another herd infected by pleuro-pneumonia
or anthrax would be used on the human herd suffering
from typhoid, or small-pox, or yellow fever, or diphtheria,
if the state had the courage to follow out
its own teachings to their logical conclusions. Who
shall say that it will not be so used some day in
the future, when increase of population shall have
made mere numbers of trifling account, and the
terrors excited by physiologists of ungovernable
force?</p>

<p class='c001'>We have gained little by the emancipation of
human society from the tyranny of the churches if
in its stead we substitute the tyranny of the state.
One may as well be burned at the stake as compelled
to submit to the prophylactic of Pasteur or the
serum of Roux. When once we admit that the law
should compel vaccination from small-pox, there is
no logical reason for refusing to admit that the law
shall enforce any infusion or inoculation which its
chemical and medical advisers may suggest to it, or
even any surgical interference with Nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the first of May, 1890, a French surgeon, M.
Lannelongue, had a little imbecile child in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>hospital; he fancied that he should like to try
trepanning on the child as a cure for imbecility. In
the words of the report,—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Il taillait la suture sagittale et parallèlement avec elle une
longue et étroite incision cranienne depuis la suture frontale à
la suture occipitale; il en resulta pour la partie osseusse une
perte de substance longue de 9 centimetres et large de 6 millimetres,
et il en resulta pour le cerveau un véritable débridement.’</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>If this child live, and be no longer imbecile, the
parents of all idiots will presumably be compelled
by law to submit their children to this operation of
trepanning and excision. Such a law would be the
only logical issue of existing hygienic laws.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the battlefield the state requires from its sons
the most unflinching fortitude; but in civil life it
allows them, even bids them, to be unblushing
poltroons.</p>

<p class='c001'>An officer, being sent out by the English War
Office this year to fill a distinguished post in Hong
Kong, was ordered to be vaccinated before going to
it; and the vaccination was made a condition of the
appointment. In this instance a man thirty years
old was thought worthy of confidence and employment
by the state, but such a fool or babe in his own
affairs that he could not be trusted to look after his
own health. You cannot make a human character
fearful and nervous, and then call upon it for the
highest qualities of resolve, of capacity, and of
courage. You cannot coerce and torment a man,
and then expect from him intrepidity, presence of
mind and ready invention in perilous moments.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few years ago nobody thought it a matter of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>slightest consequence to be bitten by a healthy dog;
as a veterinary surgeon has justly said, a scratch from
a rusty nail or the jagged tin of a sardine-box is much
more truly dangerous than a dog’s tooth. Yet in the
last five years the physiologists and the state, which
in all countries protects them, have succeeded in so
inoculating the public mind with senseless terrors
that even the accidental touch of a puppy’s lips or
the kindly lick of his tongue throws thousands of
people into an insanity of fear. Dr Bell has justly
said: ‘Pasteur does not cure rabies; he creates it.’
In like manner the state does not cure either folly or
fear: it creates both.</p>

<p class='c001'>The state is the enemy of all volition in the individual:
hence it is the enemy of all manliness, of
all force, of all independence, and of all originality.
The exigencies of the state, from its monstrous taxation
to its irritating by-laws, are in continual antagonism
with all those who have character uncowed
and vision unobscured. Under the terrorising generic
term of the law, the state cunningly, and for its own
purposes, confounds its own petty regulations and
fiscal exactions with the genuine solemnity of moral
and criminal laws. The latter any man who is not
a criminal will feel bound to respect; the former no
man who has an opinion and courage of his own will
care to observe. Trumpery police and municipal
regulations are merged by the ingenuity of the state
into a nominal identity with genuine law; and for all
its purposes, whether of social tyranny or of fiscal
extortion, the union is to the state as useful as it is
fictitious. The state has everywhere discovered that
it is lucrative and imposing to worry and fleece the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>honest citizen; and everywhere it shapes its civil
code, therefore, mercilessly and cunningly towards
this end.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the incessant meddling of government and
its offspring, bureaucracy, the man becomes poor of
spirit and helpless. He is like a child who, never
being permitted to have its own way, has no knowledge
of taking care of itself or of avoiding accidents.
As, here and there, a child is of a rare and strong
enough stuff to break his leading-strings, and grows,
when recaptured, dogged and sullen, so are there
men who resist the dogma and dictation of the state,
and when coerced and chastised become rebels to
its rules. The petty tyrannies of the state gall and
fret them at every step; and the citizen who is law-abiding,
so far as the greater moral code is concerned,
is stung and whipped into continual contumacy by
the impertinent interference of the civil code with
his daily life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why should a man fill up a census-return, declare
his income to a tax-gatherer, muzzle his dog, send
his children to schools he disapproves, ask permission
of the state to marry, or do perpetually what he dislikes
or condemns, because the state wishes him to
do these things? When a man is a criminal, the
state has a right to lay hands on him; but whilst
he is innocent of all crime his opinions and his
objections should be respected. There may be many
reasons—harmless or excellent reasons—why publicity
about his life is offensive or injurious to him;
what right has the state to pry into his privacy and
force him to write its details in staring letters for all
who run to read? The state only teaches him to lie.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>‘You ask me things that I have no right to tell
you,’ replied Jeanne d’Arc to her judges. So may
the innocent man, tormented by the state, reply to
the state, which has no business with his private life
until he has made it forfeit by a crime.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moment that the states leaves the broad lines
of public affairs to meddle with the private interests
and actions of its people, it is compelled to enlist in
its service spies and informers. Without these it
cannot make up its long lists of transgressions; it
cannot know whom to summon and what to prosecute.</p>

<p class='c001'>That duplicity which is in the Italian character so
universally ingrained there that the noblest natures
are tainted by it—a duplicity which makes entire
confidence impossible, and secrecy an instinct strong
as life—can be philosophically traced to the influences
which the constant dread of the detectives and
spies employed under their various governments for
so many centuries has left upon their national temperament.
Dissimulation, so long made necessary,
has become part and parcel of the essence of their
being. Such secretiveness is the inevitable product
of domestic espionage and trivial interference from
the state, as the imposition of a gate-tax makes the
peasantry who pass the gate ingenious in concealment
and in subterfuge.</p>

<p class='c001'>The requisitions and regulations of the state dress
themselves vainly in the pomp of law; they set
themselves up side by side with moral law; but they
are not moral law, and cannot possess its impressiveness.
Even a thief will acknowledge that ‘Thou
shalt not steal’ is a just and solemn commandment:
but that to carry across a frontier, without declaring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>it, a roll of tobacco (which you honestly bought,
and which is strictly your own) is also a heinous
crime, both common-sense and conscience refuse to
admit The Irish peasant could never be brought
to see why the private illicit whisky-still was illicit,
and as such was condemned and destroyed, and the
convictions which followed its destruction were
amongst the bitterest causes of Irish disaffection. A
man caught in the act of taking his neighbour’s goods
knows that his punishment is deserved; but a man
punished for using or enjoying his own is filled with
chafing rage against the injustice of his lot. Between
a moral law, and a fiscal or municipal or communal
imposition or decree, there is as much difference as
there is between a living body and a galvanised
corpse. When in a great war a nation is urged by
high appeal to sacrifice its last ounce of gold, its last
shred of treasure, to save the country, the response
is willingly made from patriotism; but when the
revenue officer and the tax-gatherer demand, threaten,
fine and seize, the contributor can only feel the irritating
impoverishment of such a process, and yields
his purse reluctantly. Electoral rights are considered
to give him a compensating share in the control of
public expenditure; but this is mere fiction: he may
disapprove in every item the expenditure of the
state; he cannot alter it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tolstoï has constantly affirmed that there is no
necessity for any government anywhere: it is not
<em>a</em> government, but <em>all</em> governments, on which he
wages war. He considers that all are alike corrupt,
tyrannical and opposed to a fine and free ideal of
life. It is certain that they are not ‘the control of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>the fittest’ in any actual sense, for the whole aspect
of public life tends every year more and more to
alienate from it those whose capacity and character
are higher than those of their fellows: it becomes
more and more a routine, an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>engrenage</i></span>, a trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>From a military, as from a financial, point of view
this result is of advantage to the government, whether
it be imperial or republican; but it is hostile to the
character of a nation, morally and æsthetically. In
its best aspect, the state is like a parent who seeks to
play Providence to his offspring, to foresee and ward
off all accident and all evil, and to provide for all
possible contingencies, bad and good. As the parent
inevitably fails in doing this, so the state fails, and
must fail, in such a task.</p>

<p class='c001'>Strikes, with their concomitant evils, are only
another form of tyranny; but they have this good
in them—that they are opposed to the tyranny of
the state, and tend to lessen it by the unpleasant
shock which they give to its self-conceit and
self-complacency. Trades-unions turn to their own
purposes the lesson which the state has taught them—<i>i.e.</i>,
a brutal sacrifice of individual will and welfare
to a despotic majority.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is more or less truth and justification in
all revolutions because they are protests against
bureaucracy. When they are successful, they abjure
their own origin and become in their turn the
bureaucratic tyranny, sometimes modified, sometimes
exaggerated, but always tending towards reproduction
of that which they destroyed. And the bureaucratic
influence is always immoral and unwholesome,
were it only in the impatience which it excites in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>courageous men and the apathy to which it reduces
all those who are without courage. Its manifold and
emasculating commands are to all real strength as
the cords in which Gulliver was bound by the
pygmies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The state only aims at instilling those qualities in
its public by which its demands are obeyed and its
exchequer is filled. Its highest attainment is the
reduction of mankind to clockwork. In its atmosphere
all those finer and more delicate liberties which
require liberal treatment and spacious expansion
inevitably dry up and perish. Take a homely
instance. A poor, hard-working family found a little
stray dog; they took it in, sheltered, fed it, and
attached themselves to it; it was in one of the streets
of London; the police after a time summoned them
for keeping a dog without a licence; the woman,
who was a widow, pleaded that she had taken it out
of pity, that they had tried to lose it, but that it
always came back to them; she was ordered to pay
the amount of the dog-tax and two guineas’ costs;
<i>i.e.</i>, the state said to her: ‘Charity is the costliest
of indulgences; you are poor; you have no right to
be humane.’ The lesson given by the state was the
vilest and meanest which could be given. This
woman’s children, growing up, will remember that
she was ruined for being kind; they will harden
their hearts, in accordance with the lesson; if they
become brutal to animals and men, it is the state
which will have made them so.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the state’s edicts in all countries inculcate
similar egotism; generosity is in its sight a lawless
and unlawful thing: it is so busied in urging the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>use of disinfectants and ordering the destruction of
buildings and of beasts, the exile of families and the
closing of drains, that it never sees the logical issue
of its injunctions, which is to leave the sick man
alone and flee from his infected vicinity: it is so
intent on insisting on the value of state education
that it never perceives that it is enjoining on the
child to advance itself at any cost and leave its
procreators to starve in their hovel. The virtues of
self-sacrifice, of disinterested affection, of humanity,
of self-effacement, are nothing to it; by its own form
of organism it is debarred from even admiring them;
they come in its way; they obstruct it; it destroys
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr Ruskin, in one of the papers of his <cite>Fors
Clavigera</cite>, speaks of an acacia tree, young and beautiful,
green as acacias only are green in Venice, where
no dust ever is; it grew beside the water steps of the
Academy of the Arts and was a morning and evening
joy to him. One day he found a man belonging to
the municipality cutting it down root and branch.
‘Why do you murder that tree?’ he asked. The
man replied, ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Per far pulizia</i></span>’ (to clean the place).
The acacia and the municipality of Venice are an
allegory of the human soul and its controller, the
state. The acacia was a thing of grace and verdure,
a sunrise and sunset pleasure to a great soul; it had
fragrance in its white blossoms and shade in its fair
branches; it fitly accompanied the steps which lead
to the feasts of Carpaccio and the pageants of Gian
Bellini. But in the sight of the Venetian municipality
it was irregular and unclean. So are all the graces
and greenness of the human soul to the state, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>merely requires a community tax-paying, decree-obeying,
uniform, passionless, enduring as the ass,
meek as the lamb, with neither will nor wishes; a
featureless humanity practising the goose-step in
eternal routine and obedience.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the man has become a passive creature, with
no will of his own, taking the military yoke unquestioningly,
assigning his property, educating his family,
holding his tenures, ordering his daily life, in strict
accord with the regulations of the state, he will have
his spirit and his individuality annihilated, and he
will, in compensation to himself, be brutal to all those
over whom he has power. The cowed conscript of
Prussia becomes the hectoring bully of Alsace.<a id='rO' /><a href='#fO' class='c015'><sup>[O]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Libera chiesà in libero stato</i></span>’ is the favourite stock
phrase of Italian politicians; but it is an untruth—nay,
an impossibility—not only in Italy, but in the
whole world. The church cannot be liberal because
liberality stultifies itself; the state cannot be liberal
because its whole existence is bound up with
dominion. In all the political schemes which exist
now, working themselves out in actuality, or proposed
as a panacea to the world, there is no true liberality;
there is only a choice between despotism and anarchy.
In religious institutions it is the same; they are all
egotisms in disguise. Socialism wants what it calls
equality; but its idea of equality is to cut down all
tall trees that the brushwood may not feel itself overtopped.
Plutocracy, like its almost extinct predecessor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>aristocracy, wishes, on the other hand, to
keep all the brushwood low, so that it may grow
above it at its own pace and liking. Which is the
better of the two?</p>

<p class='c001'>Civil liberty is the first quality of a truly free life;
and in the present age the tendency of the state is
everywhere to admit this in theory, but to deny it in
practice. To be able to go through the comedy of
the voting-urn is considered privilege enough to atone
for the loss of civil and moral freedom in all other
things. If it be true that a nation has the government
which it deserves to have, then the merits of all the
nations are small indeed. With some the state assumes
the guise of a police officer, and in others of a
cuirassier, and in others of an attorney; but in all it
is a despot issuing its petty laws with the pomp of
Jove; thrusting its truncheon, or its sword, or its quill
into the heart of domestic life, and breaking the backbone
of the man who has spirit enough to resist it.
The views of the state are like those of the Venetian
municipality concerning the acacia. Its one aim is a
methodical, monotonous, <a id='corr364.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mathemathically'>mathematically</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_364.22'><ins class='correction' title='mathemathically'>mathematically</ins></a></span>-measured
regularity: it admits of no expansion; it tolerates no
exceptions; of beauty it has no consciousness; of any
range beyond that covered by its own vision it is
ignorant. It may work on a large scale—even on an
enormous scale—but it cannot work on a great one.
Greatness can be the offspring alone of volition and
of genius: it is everywhere the continual effort of the
state to coerce the one and to suffocate the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fatal general conception of the state as an
abstract entity, free from all mortal blemish, and incapable
of error, is the most disastrous misconception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>into which the mind of man could possibly have
fallen. If the human race would only understand,
and take the trouble to realise, that government by
the state can be nothing better than government by
a multitude of clerks, it would cease to be enamoured
of this misconception. Government, absolute and
unelastic, by a million of Bumbles, the elevation to
supreme and most meddlesome power of a Bureaucracy
employing an army of spies and informers in
its service; this is all that the rule of the state can
ever be, or can ever mean, for mankind. It is impossible
that it should ever be otherwise.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were there some neighbouring planet, populated
by demi-gods or some angels, from whom the earth
could obtain a superior race to undertake its rule, the
domination of this superior race might be beneficial,
though it is questionable whether it would, even then,
be agreeable. Socialism calls itself liberty, but it is
the negation of liberty, since it would permit the state,
<i>i.e.</i>, the bureaucracy, to enter into and ordain every
item of private or of public life. The only sect which
has any conception of liberty is that which is called
Individualism, and it is singular and lamentable how
few followers Individualism obtains. It is due, perhaps,
to the fact that so few human beings possess
any individuality.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mass of men are willing to be dominated,
have no initiative, no ambition, no moral courage;
it is easier to them to join a herd and be driven on
with it; it saves them thought and responsibility.
Were Individualism general, there would be no standing
armies, there would be no affiliation to secret
societies, there would be no formation of the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>mind by the pressure of a public press, there would
be no acceptance of the dicta of priests and physicians,
there would be no political councils, there
would be no ministers of education. But Individualism
is extremely rare, whether as a quality or
a doctrine. Where it does exist, as in Tolstoï or
Auberon Herbert, it is regarded by the mass of men
as abnormal, as something approaching a disease.
Yet it will be the resistance of Individualism which
will alone save the world (if it be saved indeed) from
the approaching slavery of that tyranny of mediocrity
which is called the authority of the state. For government
by the state merely means government by multitudes
of hired, blatant, pompous official servants,
such as we are now blessed with; but with the powers
of those official servants indefinitely extended until
the tentacles of the state should stretch out like that
of the octopus and draw into its maw all human life.</p>

<p class='c001'>No one who studies the signs of the times can fail
to be struck by the growing tendency to invoke the
aid of what is called the state in all matters; and
those who would be alarmed and disgusted at the
despotism of a single ruler, are disposed meekly to
accept the despotism of the impalpable, impersonal
and most dangerous legislator. No one who has
observed the action of a bureaucracy can, without
dread, see its omnipotence desired; for the fact
cannot be too often repeated, that the omnipotence
of the state is the omnipotence of its minions in a
multitude of greater or smaller offices throughout the
country cursed by them. Through whom can the
espionage which is necessary to secure the working of
permissive bills, of total abstinence laws, of muzzling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>regulations, of medical and hygienic interference, be
exercised, and the vast machinery of fines and dues
which accompany these be manipulated, except by
hordes of officials gaining their livelihood by torturing
the public?</p>

<p class='c001'>The state is always spoken of as if it were an
impersonal force, magnified into semi-divinity of more
than mortal power and prescience, wholly aloof from
all human error, and meteing out the most infallible
justice from the purest balance. Instead of that the
state is nothing, can be nothing, more than a host
of parasites fastened on the body politic, more or
less fattening thereon, and trained to regard the
public as a mere taxable entity, always in the
wrong and always to be preyed upon at pleasure.
It may be unintelligible why mankind ever laid its
head under the heel of a single human tyrant, but
it is surely more perplexing still why it lies down
under the feet of a million of government spies and
scriveners. That there is a singular increase in
public pusillanimity everywhere is unquestionable;
its outcome is the tendency, daily increasing, to
look to the government in every detail and every
difficulty.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>THE PENALTIES OF A WELL-KNOWN <br /> NAME</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>When in childhood, if we be made of the stuff
which dreams ambitious dreams, we see the
allegorical figure of Fame blowing her long trumpet
down the billowy clouds, we think how delightful and
glorious it must be to have a name which echoes from
that golden clarion. Nothing seems to us worth the
having, except a share in that echoing windy blast.
To be famous: it is the vision of all poetic youth, of
all ambitious energies, of all struggling and unrecognised
talent. To be picked out by the capricious
goddess and lifted up from the crowd to sit beside
her on her throne of cloud, seems to the fancy of
youth the loftiest and loveliest of destinies.</p>

<p class='c001'>In early youth we know not what we do, we cannot
measure all we part with in seeking the publicity
which accompanies success; we do not realise that
the long trumpet of our goddess Fame will mercilessly
blow away our dearest secrets to the ears of
all, and so strain and magnify them that they will be
no more recognised by us, though become the toy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>all. We do not appreciate, until we have lost it, the
delightful unregarded peace with which the obscure
of this world can love, hate, caress, curse, move, sit
still, be sick, be sorry, be gay or glad, bear their
children, bury their dead, unnoted, untormented
unobserved.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that celebrity has its pleasant side. To
possess a name which is an open sesame wherever it is
pronounced is not only agreeable, but is often useful.
It opens doors easily, whether they be of palaces or of
railway stations; it saves you from arrest if you be
sketching fortifications; it obtains attention for you
from every one, from ministers to innkeepers; in a
word, it marks you as something out of the common,
not lightly to be meddled with, or neglected with
impunity. It has its practical uses and its daily
advantages, if it have also this prosaic drawback,
that, like other conspicuous personages, you pay
fifty per cent. dearer than ordinary people for everything
which you consume.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fame, like position, has its ugly side; whatever
phase of it be taken, whatever celebrity, notoriety,
distinction, or fashion, it brings its own penalties
with it, and it may be that these penalties underweigh
its pleasures.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most cruel of its penalties is the loss of privacy
which it entails; the difficulty which it raises
to the enjoyment of free and unobserved movement.
Whether the owner of a well-known name desire
privacy for the rest of solitude, for the indulgence
of some affection of which it is desired that the
world shall know nothing, for the sake of repose,
and ease, or for the pursuit of some especial study,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>incognito</i></span> sighed for is almost always impossible
to obtain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Find the most retired and obscure of places, amidst
hills where no foot but the herdsman’s treads, and
pastures which feel no step but those of the cattle,
a mountain or forest nook which you fondly believe
none but yourself and one other know of as existing
on the face of the globe; yet brief will be your and
your companion’s enjoyment of it if your lives, or one
of your lives, be famous; the press will track you
like a sleuth-hound, and all your precautions will be
made as naught, and, indifferent to the harm they do
or the misery they create, the Paul Prys of broadsheets
will let in the glare of day upon your dusky,
mossy dell.</p>

<p class='c001'>The artist has, no doubt, in this much for which to
blame himself: why does the dramatist deign to bow
from his box? why does the composer salute his
audience? why does the painter have shows at his
studio? why does the great writer tell his confidences
to the newspaper hack?</p>

<p class='c001'>Because they are afraid of creating the enmity and
the unpopularity which would be engendered by their
refusal. Behind this vulgar, intrusive espionage and
examination there lies the whole force of the malignity
of petty natures and inferior minds, <i>i.e.</i>, two thirds of
the world. The greater is afraid of the lesser; the
giant fears the sling or the stone of the pigmy; he
is alone, and the pigmies are multitudinous as the
drops in the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>We give away the magic belt which makes us
invisible, without knowing in the least all that we
give away with it: all that delightful independence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>and repose which are the portion of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>humbles de la
terre</i></span>, who, all the same, do not value it, do not
appreciate it; do not, indeed, ever cease from dissatisfaction
at it In their ignorance they think
how glorious it must be to stand in the white blaze
of the electric light of celebrity; how enviable and
delightful it surely is to move forever in a buzz of
wondering voices and a dust of rolling chariots, never
to stir unchronicled and never to act uncommented.
Hardly can one persuade them of the treasure
which they possess in their own obscurity? If
we tell them of it, they think we laugh at them
or lie.</p>

<p class='c001'>Privacy is the necessity of good and great art, as
it is the corollary of dignity and decorum of life.
But it is bought with a price; it is bought by incurring
the dislike and vindictiveness of all who are
checked in their petty malice and prying curiosity
and are sent away from closed doors.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ideal literary life is that of Michelet; the ideal
artistic life is that of Corot. Imagine the one leaving
the song of the birds and the sound of the seas to
squabble at a Copyright Congress, or the other leaving
his green trees and his shining waters to pour out
the secrets with which nature had intrusted him in
the ear of a newspaper reporter! If a correspondent
of the press had hidden behind an elder-bush on a
grassy path at Shottery, methinks Shakespeare would
have chucked him into the nearest ditch; and if a
stenographer had inquired of Dante what meats had
tasted so bitter to him at Can Grande’s table, beyond
a doubt the meddler would have learned the coldness
and the length of a Florentine rapier. But then no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>one of these men was occupied with his own personality,
none of them had the restless uneasiness, the
morbid fear, which besets the modern hero, lest, if his
contemporaries do not prate of him, generations to
come will know naught of him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In modern life also, the fox, with his pen and ink
hidden under his fur, creeps in, wearing the harmless
skin of a familiar house-dog, and the unhappy
hare or pullet, who has received, caressed, and fed
him without suspicion, sees too late an account of the
good nature and of his habitation travestied and sent
flying on a news sheet to the four quarters of the
globe. Against treachery of this kind there is no
protection possible. All that can be done is to be
very slow in giving or allowing introductions; very
wary in making new acquaintances, and wholly
indifferent to the odium incurred by being called
exclusive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Interrogation is always ill-bred; and an intrusion
that takes the form of a prolonged interrogation is an
intrusion so intolerable that any rudeness whatever is
justifiable in its <a id='corr372.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='repression'>repression.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_372.22'><ins class='correction' title='repression'>repression.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>The man of genius gives his work, his creation, his
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>alter ego</i></span>, to the world, whether it be in political policy,
in literary composition, in music, sculpture, painting,
or statuary. This the world has full right to judge,
to examine, to applaud, or to condemn; but beyond
this, into the pale of his private life it has no possible
title to entry. It is said in the common jargon of
criticism that without knowing the habits, temperament,
physique and position of the artist, it is impossible
to correctly judge his creation. It is, on the
contrary, a hindrance to the unbiassed judgment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>any works to be already prejudiced <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>contra</i></span> by
knowledge of the accidents and attributes of those
who have produced them. It is a morbid appetite,
as well as a vulgar taste, that makes the public invade
the privacy of those who lead, instruct, or adorn their
century, and these last have themselves to thank, in
a great measure, for the pests which they have let
loose.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every day any one who bears a name in any way
celebrated receives requests or questions from persons
who are unknown to him, demanding his views on
everything from Buddhism to blacking, and inquiring
into every detail of his existence, from his personal
affections to his favourite dish at dinner. If he deign
to answer them, he is as silly as the senders.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes you will hear that a town has been
named after you in America, or Australia, or Africa;
it is usually a few planks laid down in a barren plain,
and you are expected to be grateful that your patronymic
will be shouted on a siding as the railway
train rushes by it. Sometimes an enthusiastic and
unknown letter writer will implore you to tell him or
her ‘everything’ about yourself, from your birth
onwards; and if, as you will certainly do if you are in
your senses, you consign the impudent appeal to the
waste-paper basket, your undesired correspondent will
probably fill up the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lacuna</i></span> from his or her own imagination.
Were all this the offspring of genuine admiration,
it might be in a measure excused, though
it would always be ill-bred, noxious and odious. But
it is either an impertinent curiosity or a desire to
make money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moment that your name is well known, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>demands made upon you will be as numerous as they
will be imperative. Though you may never have
given any permission or any data for a biography,
the fact will not prevent hundreds of biographies appearing
about you: that they are fictitious and unauthorised
matters nothing either to those who publish
or to those who read. Descriptions, often wholly inaccurate,
of your habits, your tastes, your appearance,
your manner of life, will be put in circulation, no
matter how offensive or how injurious to you they
may be. Your opinions will be demanded by
strangers whose only object is to obtain for themselves
some information which they can turn to profit.
From the frequency or rarity of your dreams to the
length of your menu at dinner, nothing will escape
the insatiable appetite of an unwholesome and injurious
inquisitiveness. Obscure nonentities from Missouri
or Nevada will imagine that they honour you
by writing that they have baptised their brats in
your name, and requesting some present or acknowledgment
in return for their unwelcome effrontery in
taking you as an eponymus.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable, nay, I think, certain, that in no
epoch of the world’s history was prominence in any
art or any career ever rendered so extremely uncomfortable
as in ours, never so heavily handicapped
with the observation and penalty-weight of inquisitive
misrepresentation. All the inventions of the
age tend to increase a thousandfold all that minute
examination of and impudent interference with
others which were alive in the race in the days
of Miltiades and Socrates, but which has now, in
its so-called scientific toys, the means of gratifying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>this mischievous propensity in an infinitely greater
and more dangerous degree.</p>

<p class='c001'>The instant that any man or woman accomplishes
anything which is in any way remarkable, the curiosity
of the public is roused and fastens on his or
her private life to the neglect and detriment of his
or her creations. The composer of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘Cavalleria
Rusticana,’</span> an opera which, whatever may or may
not be its artistic merit, has had charm and melody
enough to run like a flame of fire across Italy,
awakening the applause of the whole nation, had
dwelt in obscurity and poverty up to the moment
when his work aroused a fury of delight in his
country people. Lo! the press immediately seizes
on every detail of his hard and laborious life, and
makes a jest of his long hair. What has his life or
his hair to do with the score of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘Cavalleria
Rusticana?’</span> What has the fact that he has written
music which, if not original, or spiritual, has the
secret of rousing the enthusiasm of the populace, to
do with the private circumstances, habits, or preferences
of his daily existence? It is an intolerable
impudence which can presume to pry into the latter
because the former has revealed in him that magic
gift of inspiration which makes him momentarily
master of the souls of others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The human mind is too quickly coloured, too
easily disturbed, for it to be possible to shake off
all alien bias and reflected hues; and it is more just
to the dead than to the living, because it is not by
the dead moved either to that envy or detraction,
that favour or adulation, which it unconsciously
imbibes from all it hears and knows of the living.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Whoever else may deem that the phonograph,
the telephone, and the photographic apparatus are
beneficial to the world, every man and woman who
has a name of celebrity in that world must curse
them with deadliest hatred. Life is either a miserable
and weak submission to their demands, or a
perpetual and exhausting struggle against and conflict
with their pretensions, in the course of which
warfare enemies are made inevitably and continually
by the tens of thousands. He who bends beneath
the decrees of the sovereign spy is popular at the
price of dignity and peace. Those who refuse to so
stoop are marked out for abuse and calumny from
all those who live by or are diverted by the results
of the espionage. There is no middle way between
the two; you must be the obedient slave or the irreconcilable
opponent of all the numerous and varied
forms of public inquiry and personal interference.
The walls of Varzin have never been high enough
to keep out the interviewer, and the trees of Faringford
have never been so thickly planted that they
availed to screen the study of the poet. The little,
through these means and methods, have found out
that they can annoy, harass, torment, and turn to
profit, the great. Who that knows humanity could
hope that the former would abstain from the exercise
of such power?</p>

<p class='c001'>The worst result of the literary clamour for these
arrays of facts, or presumed facts, is that the ordinary
multitude, who have not the talent of the original
seekers, imitate the latter, and deem it of more importance
to know what any famous person eats,
drinks, and wears, in what way he sins, and in what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>manner he sorrows, than it does to rightly measure
and value his picture, his position, his romance, or his
poem. Journalistic inquisitiveness has begotten an
unwholesome appetite, an impudent curiosity, in the
world, which leaves those conspicuous in it neither
peace nor privacy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The press throughout the whole world feeds this
appetite, and the victims, either from timidity or
vanity, do not do what they might do to condemn
and resist it. The interviewer too often finds his
impertinent intrusion unresented for him, or the
public which employs him, to reach any consciousness
of his intolerable effrontery. He has behind
him those many-handed powders of anathema, misrepresentation,
and depreciation which are called the
fourth estate, and almost all celebrity is afraid of
provoking the reprisals in print which would follow
on a proper and peremptory ejection of the unsought
visitor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Because a man or woman more gifted than the
common multitude bestows upon the world some
poem or romance, some picture, statue, or musical
composition, of excellence and beauty, by what possible
right can the world pry into his or her privacy
and discuss his or her fortunes and character? The
work belongs to the public, the creator of the work
does not. The invasion of private life and character
never was so great or so general as it is in the last
years of this century. It is born of two despicable
parents, curiosity and malignity. Beneath all the
flattery, which too frequently covers with flowers the
snake of inquisitiveness, the snake’s hiss of envy may
be plainly heard by those who have ears to hear. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>is the hope to find, sometime, some flaw, some moral
or physical disease, some lesion of brain or decay of
fortune, in the private life of those whom they profess
to admire or adore, which brings the interviewer
crawling to the threshold and peering through the
keyhole. What rapture for those who cannot write
anything more worthy than a newspaper paragraph
to discover that the author of ‘Salammbo’ was an
epileptic! What consolation for those who cannot
string rhymes together at a child’s party to stand
beside the bedside of Heine and watch ‘the pale
Jew writhe and sweat!’</p>

<p class='c001'>In Dalou’s monument to Eugene Delacroix he
represents the great painter with his chin sunk in
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cache-nez</i></span>, which his chilly and fragile organisation
led to his wearing generally, no matter whether
the weather were fine or foul. Dalou has outraged
art, but he has delighted his contemporaries and
crystallised their taste; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cache-nez</i></span> about the
throat of the man of genius enchants the common
herd, which catches cold perpetually, but could not
paint an inch of canvas or a foot of fresco, and feels
jealously, restlessly, malignantly, grudgingly, that the
creator of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Entreé des Croises’</span> and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Barque
de Dante,’</span> who was so far above them in all else
is brought nearer to them by that folded foulard.
The monument in the gardens of the Luxembourg
is an epitome of the sentiment of the age; time,
glory and art bend before Delacroix and offer him
the palms of immortality; Apollo throws his lyre
away in sympathy and ecstasy; but what the
mortal crowds see and applaud is the disfiguring
neckerchief!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>It is the habit of scholars to lament that so
little is known of the private life of Shakespeare.
It is, rather, most fortunate that we know so
little, and that little but vaguely. What can we
want to know more than the plays tell us? Why
should we desire to have records which, drawing
earthwards the man, might draw us also downwards
from that high empyrean of thought where
we can dwell through the magic of the poet’s
incantations?</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be a natural instinct which leads the crowd
to crave and seek personal details of the lives of
those who are greater than their fellows, but it is
an instinct to be discouraged and repressed by all
who care for the dignity of art. The cry of the
realists for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>documents humains</i></span> is a phase of it, and
results from the poverty of imagination in those who
require such documents as the scaffolding of their
creations. The supreme gift of the true artist is a
rapidity of perception and comprehension which is
totally unlike the slow piecemeal observations of
others. As the musician reads the page of a score
at a glance, as the author comprehends the essence
of a book by a flash of intelligence, as the painter
sees at a glance the points and lines and hues of a
landscape, whilst the ordinary man plods through
the musical composition note by note, the book
page by page, the landscape detail by detail, so
the true artist, whether poet, painter, or dramatist,
sees human nature, penetrating its disguises and
embracing all its force and weakness by that insight
which is within him. The catalogues, the
classifications, the microscopic examinations, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>are required to make up these ‘<em>documents</em>,’ are required
by those who have not that instantaneous
comprehension which is the supreme gift of all
supreme talent. The man who takes his notebook
and enumerates in it the vegetables, the fish, the
game, of the markets, missing no bruise on a peach,
no feather in a bird, no stain on the slab where the
perch and trout lie dying, will make a painstaking
inventory, but he will not see the whole scene as
Teniers or Callot saw it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the true poet or artist takes up in his hand
a single garden pear or russet apple, he will behold,
through its suggestions, as in a sorcerer’s mirror, a
whole smiling land of orchard and of meadow; he
will smell the sweet scent of ripe fruit and wet leaves;
he will tread a thousand grassy ways and wade in a
thousand rippling streams; he will hear the matin’s
bell and the even song, the lowing kine and the
bleating flocks; he will think in a second of time of
the trees which were in blossom when Drake and
Raleigh sailed, and the fields which were green when
the Tudor and Valois met, and the sunsets of long,
long ago, when Picardy was in the flames of war, and
all over the Norman lands the bowmen tramped and
the fair knights rode.</p>

<p class='c001'>The phrasing of modern metaphysics calls this
faculty assimilation; in other days it has been called
imagination: be its name what it will, it is the one
essential and especial possession of the poetic mind,
which makes it travel over space, and annihilate time,
and behold the endless life of innumerable forests
as suggested to it by a single green leaf. When
the writer, therefore, asks clamorously for folios on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>folios of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>documents humains</i></span>, he proves that he has
not this faculty, and that he is making an inventory
of human qualities and vices rather than a portrait
of them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>THE LEGISLATION OF FEAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c012'>To any one convinced of what seems to be a
supreme truth, that the happiness of humanity
can only be secured by the liberty of the individual,
the tendency of opinion in Europe in this present
year must be a matter of grave anxiety. The liberty
of the public is everywhere suffering from the return
to reaction of their governments. The excesses of
a few are made the excuse for the annoyance and
restriction of the many. Legislation by fear is
everywhere replacing legislation by justice, and is
likely to continue to do so. The only statesman
who has spoken of anarchy in any kind of philosophic
spirit is Lord Rosebery, who called it ‘that
strange sect of which we know so little.’ All other
political speakers have treated of it only with blind
abuse. In truth we do know almost nothing of it;
we do not know even who are its high priests and
guiding spirits. We know that it is a secret society,
and we know that secret societies have always had,
in all climes and for all races, the most singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>and irresistible fascination. To meet it, ordinary
society has only its stupid and brutal police system;
its armies of spies, who, as the journey of Caserio
from Cette to Lyons proves, are hopelessly useless,
even when they are truthful.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that, in the long run, secret societies
have always been conquered and dispersed by ordinary
society, but they are constantly reappearing in
new forms, and it is certain that they have an
extreme attraction for certain minds and classes of
men, that they exact and receive an universal
obedience which is never given to ordinary laws.
They constitute a phase, a phenomenon, of human
nature which is in itself so strange that it ought to
be examined with the most calm and open-minded
philosophy, instead of being judged by the screams
of frightened crowds and the coarse invective of such
<a id='corr383.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='politicans'>politicians</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_383.18'><ins class='correction' title='politicans'>politicians</ins></a></span> as Crispi. The curious power which can
induce young men to risk their lives, and give
them willingly to the scaffold, cannot be worthily
examined and met by a rough classification of these
men amongst monsters and wretches. That they
have been brought, in their youth, to entire insensibility
to personal danger and absolute indifference
to death, whether to suffer it or cause it, is an indisputable
fact; but no one seems to care to investigate
the means by which they are brought to this
state of feeling, nor the social causes by which this
doctrine of destruction has been begotten. They
are classed amongst criminals and sent to the
scaffold. But it is certain that they are different to
ordinary criminals; they may be much worse than
they, but they are certainly different, and are in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>sense entirely free from egotism, which is the usual
motive of common crimes, except so far as they are
seduced by the egotism of vanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible not to recognise great qualities
allied to great cruelties in anarchists and nihilists,
and, in the former, to great follies. When we remember
the ghastly punishment of even the slightest
political offences in Russia, yet see continually that
some one is found who dares place on the Tsar’s
dressing-table or writing-table a skull, a threatening
letter, a dagger, or some other emblem and menace
of death; that to do this, access is obtained into
the most private and carefully-guarded apartments
of imperial palaces; that who it is that does this
can never be ascertained (<i>i.e.</i>, there is no traitor who
betrays the secret), and that the most elaborate and
constant vigilance which terror can devise and absolutism
command is impotent to trace the manner in
which entrance is effected, we must admit that no
common organisation can be at work, and that no
common qualities must exist in those affiliated to
it. There is no doubt that anarchism is a much
more vulgar and much more guilty creed than nihilism.
The latter has the reason of its being in the
most brutal government that the world holds; it
lives in a hell and only strives to escape from that
hell, and liberate from it its fellows. Anarchy,
with no such excuse, strikes alike at the good and
the bad; strikes indeed at the good by preference.
Yet there are qualities in it which we have been
accustomed to consider virtues; there are resolution,
patience, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>sang froid</i></span> and absolute indifference to
peril; it is these which make it formidable. It also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>cannot be doubted that behind its Caserios and its
Vaillants there must be some higher intelligence,
some calm, trained, dominant minds. It has grown
up in the dark, and by stealth; unsuspected, unseen,
until it is strong enough to shake like an earthquake
the existing institutions of the world. We see the
bomb, the pistol, the knife; but we do not see the
power which directs these, any more than we see
that volcanic stratum which makes the solid earth
divide and crumble.</p>

<p class='c001'>The existing clumsy machinery of tribunals and
police offices will not have more faculty to detect
it than has the public in general. There are no
seismographic instruments in the political world.
There are only a scaffold and a house of detention.
This age, which is squeamish about execution, has
invented the infernal torture of solitary confinement.
It need not surprise us if there be a return to rack
and thumbscrew, these primitive agencies being
refined and intensified by the superior resources of
science. It is, I believe, proved that Stambuloff
tortured his political prisoners with the old-fashioned
forms of torture. These can scarcely be worse than
the solitary confinement in humid underground cells
in which Francesco Crispi causes those who displease
him to be confined. Men in the freshness of
youth, in the full promise of talent, are shut up in
these infernal holes in solitude for a score of years,
their health ruined and their minds distraught.
Many of these men have no fault whatever except
that the authorities are afraid of their political
doctrines and of the sympathy the populace feel for
them. Where is the regard for ‘life’ in these fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>sentences? Death would be a thousand times more
merciful.</p>

<p class='c001'>A youth of twenty-one was in the second week of
July condemned at Florence to fifteen months’ imprisonment
for having called the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>pretore</i></span> of a petty
court and his subordinate <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>vigliacchi</i></span> (scoundrels); an
expression so appropriate to the officials of these
vicious and corrupt little tribunals that it was unpardonable.
If at the end of the fifteen months
this lad comes out of prison at war with society,
a second Caserio, a second Vaillant, whose will be
the fault?</p>

<p class='c001'>A young lady of good family saved a little dog
from the guards in Paris, and when she had seen
it safely up its staircase turned in righteous indignation
on the men. ‘Are you not ashamed to
persecute innocent little animals?’ she said to them.
‘You would be better employed in catching thieves.’
This just remark so infuriated them, as a similar
observation did the Florentine <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>pretore</i></span>, that they
seized her, cuffed her, dragged her along under
repeated blows, tearing some of her clothes off her
back, and, reaching the police-station, locked her
up with the low riff-raff of the streets. This took
place in a fashionable quarter of Paris. If the male
relatives of the young gentlewoman had lynched the
guards who thus outraged her they would only have
done their duty; but we know that the Parisian
tribunals would have condemned them had they done
so, and absolved the rascally myrmidons of the law.
There is no justice anywhere if police are compromised
by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Mantua, in the month of August of this year,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>a poor woman, who has five children to maintain by
her daily labour, was arrested by a guard for bathing
in a piece of water outside the town (she ought to
have been rewarded for her unusual cleanliness); and
being taken before the tribunal she was sentenced
to a fine. She exclaimed as she heard the sentence,
‘And the brigadier who brought this misery on me
has his decoration!’ She was condemned to further
punishment for the rebellious utterance; her defender,
a young lawyer, in vain protested, and, for thus
protesting, was himself arrested and charged with
the misdemeanour of endeavouring ‘to withdraw a
prisoner from just authority’! Can anything be
more infamous?</p>

<p class='c001'>In July at Ravenna eight young lads were flung
into prison for singing the Hymn of Labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet more absurd still. In Florence a band of
young men were arrested for singing the choruses
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Prophète</cite></span>, which sounded revolutionary to
the ears of the police. At the same time, the indulgence
shown to the crimes of the police is boundless.</p>

<p class='c001'>A poor man named Pascia was, in the same city, last
week condemned to thirty-five days’ imprisonment for
having said an impudent word to the guards. On
hearing the sentence his wife, a young woman with
a baby in her arms, expostulated, asking who would
now earn her own and her child’s bread. She was
arrested, and locked up for the night on the charge
of ‘outraging authority.’</p>

<p class='c001'>On the twenty-second of April of this year, Alfredo
Ghazzi, Customs-house guard on the Italian border
of the Tresa, fired into a fishing-boat on the Tresa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>having received no provocation whatever, and maimed
two men, named Zennari and Zannori, of whom the
former died; the latter, after a long illness recovered.
The military tribunal of Milan <em>entirely</em> absolved the
guard Ghazzi.</p>

<p class='c001'>For an offence of the kind (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>reanto arbitrario in
servizio</i></span>), even though ending in its victim’s death,
the legal maximum of punishment is only two years’
imprisonment; but in this instance not even a fine
was levied.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Prussia the murder of men, women and children
is frequent by the bayonets and the bullets of guards
and sentinels. The other day a little boy was on the
grass of a square in Berlin; the guard tried to arrest
him; the child, frightened, ran away; the guard shot
him dead. Such occurrences are frequent. If a
newspaper condemns them the editor is imprisoned.
It is wholly illogical to tell anarchists that human
life is sacred when its sanctity can be disregarded at
will by any soldier or police officer. The public was
convulsed with horror before the assassination of Carnot;
quite rightly; but why is it wholly unmoved at
the assassination of the fishermen of Tresa, or of
the child of Berlin?</p>

<p class='c001'>The English nation has not perhaps been greatly
interested in the fate of the conscript Evangelisto;
has perhaps never heard of him. Briefly, he was, in
the spring of this year, a young trooper, a peasant
who had recently joined at Padua, could not learn to
ride and had weak health; he was bullied to death
by the officer immediately over him; he was made to
ride with his feet tied beneath his horse, when he fell
he was pulled up into the saddle and beaten, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>hands being tied; once again he fell, and then never
rose again; they swore at him and flung water over
him in vain; he was dead. The officer who killed him
is still at large and retains his position in the cavalry;
being young, rich, and of rank, he drives four-in-hand
about Udine, where he is now quartered, and when
he is hissed and hooted by the country people they
are arrested. Now, if the Italian press were to say
what it has not said about this disgraceful affair under
the new law, such lawful and proper censure would
be called calumny of the army, and would be visited
with fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soldier is to be inviolable and revered as a god,
when his bayonet or his sabre are the instruments of
oppression of the government; but at other times he
is considered as carrion with which his superiors may
do whatever they choose.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is constantly stated that the officer who tortured
Evangelisto to death will be brought to trial, but
months have elapsed since the tragedy and the young
man is still enjoying himself<a id='rP' /><a href='#fP' class='c015'><sup>[P]</sup></a> in full possession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>his military rank. How could any public writer, who
does his duty to the public, castigate too severely such
atrocities as these?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even to hint at the brutality which goes on in
the barracks is considered almost treason in Italy
even as in Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>The legislation of fear goes hand in hand with a
military despotism. The one is the outcome of the
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The commercial world, the financial world, and the
world of pleasure are beside themselves with terror.
In Italy this passion of fear is being used to secure
the passing of laws which will completely paralyse
the press and enable the government on any pretext
to carry away its foes out of the Chambers, and
to confine to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>domicilio coatto</i></span> any person, male or
female, in whom it may suspect any danger to itself,
or who may be merely personally disliked by the
men in office.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no exact equivalent in English for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>domicilio
coatto</i></span>; it means the right of Government to send
anyone it pleases to reside in any district it selects,
for as long a period as it may choose to ordain. A
journalist was the other day arrested in Rome whilst
talking with a friend, his offence being the expression
of republican opinions. He was ordered to reside in
an obscure village where he had been born, but which
he had left when in swaddling clothes; his house,
family and means of livelihood were all in Rome. He
had been previously domiciled in Bologna, whence he
had been expelled for the same offence of opinion.
The confinement of a man of this profession to an
obscure and remote village is, of course, the deprivation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>of all his means of livelihood. There is nothing
he can do in such a place; meanwhile his family
must starve in Rome or wherever they go.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another journalist, merely accused of <em>desiring
another form of government than the monarchial</em>, was
put in the felon’s dock, loaded with chains and
surrounded by gendarmes, in the same place where
Paolo Lega had been sentenced an hour before. A
seller of alabaster statuettes and ornaments, though
there was nothing against him except the suspicion
of the police, was so harrassed by the latter in Civita
Vecchia that he sold off all his stock at ruinous prices,
and went towards Massa, his native place, hoping to
dwell there in peace; he was, however, arrested at
Corneto, on a vague charge of anarchism and flung
into prison. These are only a few examples out of
thousands. Can any better plan be devised for the
conversion of industrious, harmless and prosperous
persons into paupers and criminals?</p>

<p class='c001'>It apparently seems a little thing to the violent old
man who throughout 1894 has been unfortunately
paramount in Italy, to uproot men from their homes
and occupations and pitchfork them into some hamlet
where they were born, or some barren sea-shore or
desolate isle. But to a man who maintains himself
by the work of either his hands or his brain, such
deportation from the place where all his interests lie,
is a sentence of ruin and starvation for him and his
family; and if the Government gives him a meagre
pittance to keep life in him (which it does not do
unless he is actually a criminal or one condemned as
such), all the women and children belonging to him
must fall into complete misery, being deprived of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>his support. The English Press takes no notice of
these seizures of citizens, and their condemnation to
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>domicilio coatto</i></span>, perhaps it does not comprehend what
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>domicilio coatto</i></span> means; or perhaps it thinks that it
would not matter at all to a journalist, a solicitor, or a
merchant, living and working in York, in Exeter, or
in London, to be suddenly transported thence to
some obscure hamlet in Hants, in Connaught, or in
Merionethshire, and ordered never to leave that place.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a project for deporting all those thus
uprooted and condemned in Italy to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘<i>domicilio coatto</i>,’</span>
to an island on the Red Sea, there to rot out their
wretched lives in fever and famine. On a barren
shore, where not a blade of grass will grow, in face of
a sun-scorched sea which no vessel ever visits save
once a year, the skiffs of pearl-fishers, many of the
most intelligent, the most disinterested, and the most
patriotic men of Italy will be left to die by inches in
the festering heat, deriving what consolation they
may from the reflection that whilst honest men are
thus dealt with for the sin of political opinion, the
men who forged, robbed and disgraced their nation,
at the Banca Romana, are set at liberty and caressed
and acclaimed by the populace.</p>

<p class='c001'>‘I hope the country will draw a parallel between
Tanlungo and ourselves,’ said Dr Barbato, a man of
high talent and character, who has been condemned
to the agonies of solitary confinement in the prisons
of Perugia for political offences; he is well known as
a writer; and when the famous Liberal deputy,
Cavallotti, was allowed to see him the other day, he
merely said that he hoped he might be allowed more
air, as the confinement to his cell made him suffer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>from almost continual vertigo, which prevented him
from pursuing any intellectual thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fortresses, prisons and penitentiaries are
crowded all over Italy with prisoners, many of them
as worthy of respect as Dr Barbato, as innocent as
Molinari, as high-spirited and noble-hearted as De
Felice. Under the additions which have been made
to the Code in the last parliamentary sessions these
captives will be increased by thousands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is the text of some articles in the draft of
the new laws recently passed at Montecitorio:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘Whoso uses the press to excite to crime, does not merely
commit an offence of the press but commits a common felony,
with the aggravation of turning to a felonious purpose an instrument
designed to uphold education and instruction. Whereas
the destructive aim of those who would reduce existing society
to the last gasp, is above all, to inoculate the army with the
passion of discord and insubordination, the army which is our
joy and pride by its example of patriotism, of self-denial, and of
self-sacrifice, we propose, with the second article of this projected
addition to the code, a punishment for this especial offence
which, as the code stands at present, escapes penal chastisement.
Thus we propose that any incitement to lawlessness, any propaganda
leading to insubordination and rebellion, do not cease to
be felonious offences because the offender employs the medium
of the press instead of that of speech, and ... this form of
offence should also be raised to the honour (<i>sic</i>) of a crime meet
to be judged by the assizes whenever the offender shall use for
such purpose the public press, and the greater gravity of the
offence shall render it more ignoble, and shall not any longer
allow it to escape under an aureole of political glory.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It then proceeds to provide that such offence shall
be punishable by a term of not less <a id='corr393.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='that'>than</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_393.33'><ins class='correction' title='that'>than</ins></a></span> five and of
not more than ten years; and it is plain with what
ease this clause may be stretched to comprehend and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>condemn every phase of liberal opinion in any way
obnoxious to the Government in power.</p>

<p class='c001'>Literature itself is threatened in the most perilous
and insolent manner by the following lines in
Article 2 of this Crispian programme:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘Whosoever by means of the press, or in whatever other
figurative sense (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>qualsiasi altro senso figurativo</i></span>) instigates the
military to disobey any law, or to be lacking in respect to their
superiors, or to violate in any manner the duties of discipline,
or the decorum of the army or of men under arms, or exposes
it to the dislike or the ridicule of civil persons, shall be punished
by imprisonment of a term varying from three to thirty months,
and with the fine of from three hundred to three thousand
francs.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>With such a comprehensive decree as this the
delightful <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Abbozzi Militare</cite></span> of De Amicis might be
condemned as wanting in respect, whilst Dante,
were he living, would be sent much further than
Ravenna.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every one who attacks in print existing institutions
is to be dragged into a criminal court, and
from thence to prison; the philosophic republican,
the meditative layman, who dares to bring his well-weighed
thoughts to bear against existing institutions,
will be set in the same dock with the thief, the
forger, and the murderer, and from the dock will
pass to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ergastolo</i></span>, to the diet, the clothes, and
the existence, of common felons.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a violation of intellectual and personal
liberty which does not concern Italian writers alone; it
is one which should rouse the alarm, the indignation
and the sympathy of every thinker in every clime
who from his study endeavours to enlighten and

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Stripped of its pompous verbiage this addition to
the Code will enable the government to silence and
put away every public writer, orator, pressman, or
deputy, who is displeasing or annoying to them.
Observe the provision to treat as penal all judgments
of the press passed on verdicts of the tribunals. The
tribunals are at present merely held in some slight
check by the expression of public opinion given in
the daily press. This check is to be removed and
the most conscientious, the most honourable of
journalists, may be treated as a common malefactor
and deprived of trial by jury. To be judged by jury
has hitherto been the inalienable right of newspaper
proprietors or of contributors to the press. It is
impossible to exaggerate this menace to the liberties
of the press. An insolent and unscrupulous minister,
and a timid and servile parliament, have reduced the
Italian press to the level of the Russian press.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is scarcely any political article which the
ingenuity of a public prosecutor could not twist into
a criminal offence, and this project of law is so
carefully worded that the meshes of its net are wide
enough to entrap all expressions of opinion. Anything
by its various sections may be construed into
incitement to disorder or rebellion. John Bright and
Stuart Mill would be condemned with Krapotkine
and <a id='corr395.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Tolstoi'>Tolstoï</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_395.26'><ins class='correction' title='Tolstoi'>Tolstoï</ins></a></span>. A writer writing against conscription
would be treated as equally guilty with one writing
in favour of regicide.</p>

<p class='c001'>The assassination of opinion is a greater crime
than the assassination of a man. John Milton has
said that, ‘It is to hit the image of God in the eye.’</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole provisions of these new laws are no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>less infamous; they will legalise arbitrary and unexplained
arrest, and will condemn to ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>domicilio
coatto</i></span>’ any deputy or citizen who may be suspected
or obnoxious, and the law can be stretched to
include and smite the simplest expression of individual
views, the mere theory and deductions of
philosophic studies.</p>

<p class='c001'>This paper could under it be easily attacked as an
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>apologia pro anarchia</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The printing press may not be an unmixed good,
but it is certain that the absolute freedom of its
usage is its right and its necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The purpose of anarchism in its outrages is no
doubt to make all government impossible through
terror, but they will probably only succeed in making
through terror every government a tyranny.
The extent to which terror can carry already
existing governments is nowhere seen so conspicuously
as in Italy, where reaction is violent and
entirely unscrupulous in its paroxysm of fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is grotesque, it is impudent, of such governments
as exist at the close of this century to expect that
any writer, gifted with any originality of thought and
having the courage of his opinions, should be content
with them or offer them any adulation. The governments
of the immediate moment are conspicuous
for all the defects which must irritate persons of
any intelligence and independence. All have overwhelmed
their nations with fiscal burdens; all lay
the weight of a constant preparation for war on their
people; all harass and torment the lives of men by
meddlesome dictation; all patronise and propagate
the lowest forms of art; all muddle away millions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>the public treasure; all are opportunists with neither
consistency nor continuity. There is not a single
government which can command the respect of any
independent thinker. Yet we are told to revere
government as a sacred custodian throned upon the
purity of spotless snows!</p>

<p class='c001'>‘Two things are necessary to this country—liberty
and government,’ said Casimir-Perier in his opening
address. He might have added that no one has ever
yet succeeded in making the two dwell in unison.
Liberty and government are dog and cat; there can
be no amity or affinity between them. Governments
are sustained because men make a sacrifice, sometimes
compulsory, sometimes voluntary, of their
liberties to sustain government. What is the idea of
liberty which Casimir-Perier has in his mind? This
kind of nobly sounding phrase is much beloved by
<a id='corr397.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='politicans'>politicans</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_397.18'><ins class='correction' title='politicans'>politicans</ins></a></span>; they usually mean nothing by them. He
will certainly leave the Prefectures and all their
subordinates as he finds them; he will allow the
Department of Seine et Oise to be poisoned, despite
its inhabitants’ piteous protests; he will sustain and
probably give still more power to the police and the
detective system; he will not prevent arbitrary arrests
in the streets of innocent persons, nor domiciliary
visits on suspicion to private houses; he certainly
will not touch conscription; he in all likelihood will
revive obsolete press laws, and he will without doubt
harass and muzzle the socialists on every occasion;
he will have his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Cabinet Noir</i></span> and secret services like
the ministers of the Empire, and he will not alter
by a hair’s breadth the spoliation of the public for
taxation, the worry of the citizen by bye-laws, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>corruption of municipal and political elections, and
the impossibility for any Royalist to obtain justice
at any <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mairie</i></span>, prefecture, or tribunal.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the Republican can obtain no justice in Germany,
as the Jew can obtain none in Russia, as the Ecclesiastic
and the Socialist alike can obtain none in Italy,
so the Royalist and the Socialist alike can obtain
none in France. The same tendency to mete out
justice by political weights and measures is to be
observed in England, although not to so great an
extent, because in England the character and position
of judges and magistrates are far higher and less
accessible to corruption and prejudice. Yet even
there, since political bias is allowed to influence the
issue of cards for State balls, and admittance to the
opening of State Ceremonies, it will soon inevitably
influence legal decisions in the country. Interference
with the freedom of the press would not yet in a
political sense be tolerated in England, but its tribunals
have come grievously near to it in some recent
verdicts, and the mere existence of Lord Campbell’s
Vigilance Society is an invasion of the liberty of
literature; whilst the steps to be taken are not many
which would carry the <cite>Times</cite> the <cite>Post</cite> the <cite>Standard</cite>,
and many other journals from their servile adulation
of the sham Sylla of Italy to the advocacy of a similar
tyranny to his over Great Britain. Neither Conservatism
nor Radicalism is any protection against
tyranny, <i>i.e.</i>, incessant interference with the individual
liberty of the citizen; and republics are as opposed to
individualism as monarchies and empires.</p>

<p class='c001'>Carnot lies dead in the Pantheon, and liberty lies
dying in the world. His tender and unselfish heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>would have ached with an impersonal sorrow, greater
even than his grief for those he loved, could he have
known that his death would have been made an
excuse for intemperate authority and pusillanimous
power to gag the lips and chain the strength of
nations.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
